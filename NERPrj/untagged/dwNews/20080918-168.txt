 China's milk scandal has continued to escalate amid reports that a wide range of dairy products have been found contaminated. 
 The latest discoveries were made in the southern territory of Hong Kong, where melamine had been discovered in milk drinks, ice creams and yoghurt made by the leading Yili brand. The government has now recalled all the company's products. The news came as Chinese officials reported a fourth baby had died in the northwest Xinjiang region after drinking milk made of a powder containing the chemical melamine. More than 6,000 babies across the country have been fallen ill so far. Meanwhile the authorities have continued nationwide checks on milk powder and have made 12 new arrests in connection to the scandal.
