 The violence in Urumqi in China’s western Xinjiang region continued on Wednesday. There were reports of several incidents of mobs of Han Chinese armed with wooden bats, shovels and other makeshift weapons attacking Uighurs on the streets. Chinese President Hu Jintao rushed back to his country after cutting short a visit to L’Aquila, Italy, where he was due to attend the G8 summit.
