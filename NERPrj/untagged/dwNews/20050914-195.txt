 German engineering conglomerate Linde said Wednesday it had won a contract worth 140 million euros ($172 million) to build the world's largest ethylene plant in China. The contract was awarded by PetroChina international and was signed by the two companies on Sunday, Linde said in a statement. The plant, which would go onstream in the second half of 2008, will produce one million tons of ethylene each year and 500,000 tons of propylene, Linde said.
