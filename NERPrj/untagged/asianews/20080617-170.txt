 Tight security measures are put in place in the Muslim region for fear of terrorist attacks. Beijing claims sound relations between minorities but the Uyghur鈥檚 seek autonomy and greater freedom from Chinese colonisation. Dozens of Uyghur鈥檚 charged with 鈥渢errorism鈥� await trial and the death sentence. 
 Urumqi (AsiaNews/Agencies) 鈥� The Olympic torch today began its three day tour of Xinjiang region, where Beijing fears terrorist attacks from local Muslim minorities.聽The torch鈥檚 itinerary, which takes in four cities, started out today in Urumqi鈥檚 central peoples鈥� square, amidst police security checks and crowds controlled by metal detectors.聽 The local government advised people not to participate in the event but to watch it on the TV from the safety of their homes.聽 Of the 3 thousand people who made their way to the square, the vast majority were Chinese, with very few Uyghur鈥檚, the original local Muslim population.聽 聽Before the commencement of ceremonies a minutes silence was observed in memory of the victims of the Sichuan earthquake.聽Banners and signs proclaimed that the minorities present in the region 鈥済et along well鈥�. The reality is that the situation in Xinjiang closely resembles that of Tibet. 聽The 9 million Uyghur鈥檚 of Turkmen origin who have their own language and are of Islamic religion seek greater autonomy and more influence on the economic, political and social well being of the region, currently dominated by colony鈥檚 of Han (ethnic Chinese). For decades Beijing has exercised a violent control policy on the mosques, schools and people, justifying its actions with its fear of terrorism.聽Months ago the Chinese government accused groups of planning terrorist attacks in the run up to the Olympics. But local and exiled Uyghurs claim the declarations are false and that they aim to justify China鈥檚 heavy handedness in the region. The testimonies of some Uyghurs reveal that police have stopped thousands of Muslims confiscating their passports. The Hong Kong based human rights and democracy centre reports that there are at least 65 activists from Xinjiang awaiting trial and being held on terrorism charges.聽The human rights group confirms that these people have been charged with plotting to sabotage the Olympic Games adding that at least 20 of these risk the death penalty. Tomorrow the torch arrives in Kashgar; later in the week it will pass through the cities of Shihezi and Changji. 聽
