 After 10 days of joint military exercises, leaders of the armed forces of China and Pakistan have said they are ready for joint action to eradicate terrorism, extremism and separatism in their territories. 
 Islamabad (AsiaNews) 鈥� China 鈥渋s ready to conduct an anti-terrorism drive in Asia withPakistan for lasting peace and mutual prosperity鈥�, said the Chinese General Lu Dengming, Chief of Staff of the Chendu military region. He was speaking at the concluding session of 10 days of joint military exercises betweenPakistan and China. The general said: 鈥淔or many years Pakistan and China have remained focused on economic development and regional stability; at the same time we are confronting three evil forces 鈥� terrorism, extremism and separatism.鈥� In such a scenario, 鈥渢he whole world must benefit each other and enhance cooperation to combat these evils.Beijing is against all forms of terrorism and insists on international cooperation and the conducting of anti-terrorism campaigns.鈥� Li said the Pakistani army is 鈥渉ighly professional: it has advanced technological arms and dedicated troops. We were impressed by the high quality of the exercises.鈥� The statements made by the Pakistani Corps Commander, General Tariq Majid, were in the same vein. He told a press conference: 鈥淥ur country andChina have many shared enemies: standing united, we can eliminate the menace of terrorism, which is affecting the entire fabric of human society.鈥� The issue of terrorism is keenly felt byBeijing that is trying in all ways possible to prevent what it calls 鈥減opular uprisings鈥� in the northern region of Xinjiang, the homeland of the ethnic Uighurs of Muslim faith. The region borders Afghanistan, Pakistan, Russia, Mongolia and three ex-Soviet Republics of centralAsia. 聽Many human rights activists insist 鈥渢errorism鈥� is used as an excuse by the Communist government to persecute the Uighur minority. The decision to hold the exercises was taken during the visit in Pakistan of the Chinese president Hu Jintao and they follow another set held inChina in 2004. The recent drills were unique because they marked the first time Chinese troops left their country to do exercises abroad. Beijing is the main supplier of conventional arms to Pakistan but many analysts claim the Chinese government also backsIslamabad鈥檚 nuclear and missile programmes.
