 At least two dead and dozens arrested in a recent police raid in Urumqi. But human rights groups denounce that it is a pretext to undermine aspirations for independence. The survival of an entire ethnic group at risk. 
 Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) 鈥� The Chinese government has defended its right to 鈥渂attle terrorism鈥� in Xinjiang, saying its stance was 鈥渘o different from the rest of the world鈥�. But human rights organisations denounce that the annihilation of an entire population is underway in the region. State agency Xinhua reported that on January 27th in the Xinjiang capital Urumqi, the largest anti terrorism operation in over a year was carried out resulting in the death of 2 terrorists and 15 arrests, accused of collaborating with the Islamic movement of eastern Turkestan, an organisation which the United Nations has branded as terrorist.聽Instead Hong Kong鈥檚 Sing Tao Daily reports that at least 18 people were killed. No further news is to be had regarding the episode because Beijing has imposed rigid control on all information from the region, considered essential given its vast energy resources and strategic position in central Asia.聽However some critics 鈥� among them the United Nations鈥� accuse China of using terrorism a san excuse to quash peaceful aspirations for independence and to pursue a systematic elimination of the local people, the Uyghur, followers of Islam with their own language and traditions.聽Beijing gas favoured the immigration of millions of ethnic Han, conceding them trade incentives and access to positions of power.聽These have hit out at the local language and traditions and place obstacles in the way of the practise of the Islamic faith: women and minors are not allowed to enter mosques and Islamic schools are forbidden.聽 Moreover they have vastly reduced the number of pilgrims allowed to journey to Mecca.聽 The episodes of terrorism, which have been isolated, are being used as a pretext to deny vast swathes of the population their basic human rights. In 2005 18,227 Uyghur were arrested because they 鈥渢hey were a threat to national security鈥�. 聽
