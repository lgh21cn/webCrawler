 The heavy presence of China鈥檚 military in Tibet constitutes a threat to India鈥檚 sovereignty and economy. Beijing鈥檚 policies vis-脿-vis minorities are 鈥渨rong and disastrous鈥�. 
 Dharamsala (AsiaNews) 鈥� The celebration by the People鈥檚 Republic of China鈥檚 of 60 years of Communist Party rule celebrates 鈥�60 years of violence, lies and oppression against the people of Tibet, East Turkistan and China,鈥� the leaders of the Tibetan Youth Congress (TYC) said. The TYC is an exile group fighting for the rights of the Tibetan people. In New Delhi, thousands of Indians and Tibetan rallied against Beijing鈥檚 violent protest. Just like the Beijing Olympics, this new show put forth by the Communist Party is another attempt to improve China鈥檚 image in the world and win recognition for China as a world leader in global affairs. China will showcase its finest and most advanced military weapons in its televised National Day parade. Its constant race to acquire and build its military hardware is not only alarming; it is a warning to the world of China鈥檚 so-called 鈥減eaceful rise鈥�. Today Beijing is celebrating China鈥檚 might, economic miracle, military prowess and space programmes. But in New Delhi, thousands of Indians and Tibetans have organised a protest against the Chinese Communist regime. For TYC leaders, the heavy presence of China鈥檚 military in Tibet, represents 鈥渁 direct threat to India on security, economy and environment.鈥� For them, the 鈥渃ontinuing and ever-increasing Chinese infiltrations and incursions on Indian soil鈥� are motive for deep concern. For the youth group, not only has the Chinese government 鈥渋llegally occupied and colonised Tibet, East Turkistan and Southern (Inner) Mongolia; it has carried out many wrong and disastrous policies that have resulted in the death of over 30 million Chinese people.鈥� The Communist Party has held onto political power through the 鈥渦se of brute force鈥�, and lost 鈥渢he respect of its own people.鈥� The Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 and the ongoing human rights violation in Tibet, Xinjiang, Manchuria and Inner Mongolia are cases in point, which often come close to resembling a 鈥減olicy of genocide conducted with impunity鈥�. According to the TYC, the rapid transfer of millions of Han Chinese to Tibet marginalises the indigenous population, turning Tibetans into a minority in their own country. More than 500,000 troops and a network of railways, roads, bridges and tunnels support a vast military infrastructure built in Tibet to clamp down, among other things, on any form of dissent. The 鈥淐hinese government lacks legitimacy in Tibet and exercises control over Tibet through military force,鈥� the TYC said. For the group, this belies China鈥檚 commitment to a harmonious society, so dear to President Hu Jintao. 鈥淐hina voted to adopt the Universal Declaration in 1948, and pledged to uphold human rights [. . .]. However, it continues to ignore and violate all the articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other Covenants it has signed,鈥� the TYC noted. Unless the voice of 鈥淭ibetans, Uyghurs, and Chinese [. . .] is respected and not silenced, China鈥檚 celebrations will only be in vain.鈥� NC)
