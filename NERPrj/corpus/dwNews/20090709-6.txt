A Tentative Calm Reigns Over Urumqi
<\TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
Chinese President Hu Jintao said that rioters in the western Xinjiang region would be "severely punished" on Thursday. He described last Sunday's ethnic violence as a "serious and violent crime, masterminded and organised by forces from abroad and at home". Itwas Huâ€™s first official statement on the riots since he cut short a visit to Italy where he was due to attend the G8 summit. Meanwhile, Chinese state media claimed that the regional capital Urumqi had returned to normal.
