Seeking asylum in Afghanistan
<\TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
The plight of Afghan refugees is known, but less familiar are the dissidents and victims of civil war who have sought refuge in Afghanistan although the war-torn country has no asylum law as yet.

 Amir Hamza Halimov fled to Kabul in the early 1990s. He was one of tens of 
thousands of Tajiks who crossed the border to Afghanistan when Emomali Rahmon 
became president and civil war broke out in Tajikistan.

 Most returned after the end of the war but Halimov, a dissident who feared 
repercussions because of his anti-regime activity if he returned, stayed in 
Afghanistan. He and his two sons live in a guesthouse provided by the Afghan 
Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations.

 The ministry has provided accommodation to about 150 asylum seekers from 
Iran, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Iraq. Although there is no asylum 
law, it acts according to the tradition ofnanawatai that allows a beleaguered 
person, even an enemy, to enter the house of any other person and make a 
request of him which cannot be refused, even at the cost of the host's own life 
or fortune.

 There are also countless numbers of separatists from Indian-administered 
Kashmir who have taken refuge in Afghanistan as well as Muslims from China's 
Xinjiang province.

Confused status

 Until now, Halimov's food and living expenses had been covered by the 
ministry but he says this support stopped three months ago. Now he has to buy 
food on credit. He cannot work because his status is unclear. He has spent six 
years going from one authority to the next to clear his case but in vain. He is 
still not officially recognized as an asylum seeker nor does he have Afghan 
nationality.

 The Afghan president has the right to grant Afghan nationality if he wants 
to. Earlier this month, four Iranians who fled their country after taking part 
in post-election protests in 2009 were granted Afghan nationality by President 
Hamid Karzai.

 The government is currently drafting asylum and nationality legislation. 
Finally Afghanistan will be "a country that can provide refuge in the classical 
sense" says Karl Kopp from German rights organization Pro Asyl. People 
persecuted for political reasons or fleeing civil war will be able to apply for 
asylum. The country can be a "corridor of protection" in a region where there 
is no traditional system of protection. However, Kopp points out that the main 
problem is still how to create stable, secure conditions in the devastated 
country.
