TFF Rudolstadt: A big festival without big names
<\TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
What kind of rock music is China making, and what do hip-hop and old English dance styles have in common? The 22nd edition of the TFF Rudolstadt festival had some answers - and much more.

 Joy and sadness came all at once at Germany's largest world music festival. 
Some of the finest concertina players in the world had arranged for a joint 
concert, rehearsing together for a week ahead of time. One of them was 84-
year-old Horst Foit. Before his appearance, he had said that he simply could 
not believe that so many people wanted to hear his music.

But he suffered a heart attack while standing overjoyed on stage. The concert 
had to be cancelled, and Foit went to the emergency room. The other musicians 
decided to make up the concertina program the next night, devoting it to their 
colleague.
 

Rudolstadt prize-winners: the Al Andaluz Project

The concertina, a baby cousin of the accordion, was one focal point of the 22nd
Dance and Folk Festival in Rudolstadt (TFF Rudolstadt), which ended this week 
after hosting 85,000 visitors at 20 festival stages. With 163 acts, bands, 
ensembles and artists from 40 countries, the festival again offered its special 
blend of traditional and contemporary global and local music, from folk and 
reggae to hip-hop, country and Chinese opera.

Diverse genres from China

 There are probably two things that spring to mind when people in the West 
think of music from China: cheesy pop songs at a local Chinese joint and the 
often inaccessible Chinese opera with its dramatic effects and shrill vocals.

But that's far from all China has to offer musically, as festival-goers this 
year could discover. There was opera, but there was also music of the Uyghur, a 
Muslim ethnic minority. The band Er Shou Mei Gui offered contemporary rock music
, and singer Gong Linna appeared with the first Chinese folk music choir, 
DaBaiSong. Gong Linna also took part in an orchestral project featuring the 
Thuringian State Symphony Orchestra, whose members have appeared at the TFF 
Rudolstadt for several years.
 

Street musicians of every stripe take to the festival

Dancing in the streets

 Even for seasoned TFF fans, it's a welcome surprise each year to see how 
engaged the audience is at the events. There are countless street music 
ensemblesthat play everywhere in the city, and numerous visitors also bring 
along their instruments. They like to jam out wherever they please, or they can 
head to the various concerts and workshops where there are chances to dance and 
play along.

Street dance styles ranging from folk to hip-hop are still an important 
ingredient in the Rudolstadt music mix. The amateurs in Rudolstadt perform at a 
high level. Providing the backdrop around nearly every corner are the sounds of 
solo guitarists, percussion ensembles, cajon players and even entire Balkan 
combos.

 When the weather permits, the street music is often as big of a draw as the 
stage programming.

Prize-winning unknowns
 

Hannes Wader won the festival's lifetime achievement award

Ruth is the name of the world music award presented annually to three 
musicians at TFF Rudolstadt. This time, protest singer Hannes Wader from 
Germany received the award for lifetime achievement. Wader confessed that he had
not yet received a single prize in his 50-year career as an artist and that at 
his age he prefers to write songs about death or women than about current 
political affairs.

The Al Andaluz Project, a consortium of German, Spanish and Moroccan musicians
, was also awarded a prize, as well as the Strottern, who now play their 
modernist, blues-filled Viennese songs with backing from wind players.

 There are very few big names in Rudolstadt, even among the prize-winners, but 
the festival doesn't live from star power. There are, however, a few exceptions 
in each year's program, like German reggae superstar Gentleman or American 
singer-songwriter Alison Krauss in 2012.

 The draw of Rudolstadt lies much more in the discovery of the new, and in 
being part of a spring-up community that is singular in Germany's festival 
season.
