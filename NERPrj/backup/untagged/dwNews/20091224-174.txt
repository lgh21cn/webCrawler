 On Oct. 1 2009, Beijing鈥檚 Tiananmen Square was transformed into a stage to celebrate the founding of the People鈥檚 Republic of China 60 years ago. There was a large military parade to demonstrate China's military might. Despite the country's economic strengths, it still has far to go in terms of human rights. 
 President Hu Jintao opened the 60th anniversary ceremony to firing canons, wearing a suit like Mao Zedong's. A two-hour parade, which included tanks and missiles, 8,000 soldiers, 60 floats and 100,000 well trained civilians symbolised the country鈥檚 growing military and economic might. But there was much criticism of China on the occasion. In Hong Kong, for example, there were massive demonstrations against the lack of progress on human rights and democracy. Earlier on in 2009, on the 50th anniversary of the failed Tibetan uprising in March, people all over the world demonstrated for Tibet鈥檚 autonomy. After 50 years in exile, the Dalai Lama has not given up the fight. 鈥淭he problem with the People鈥檚 Republic of China is that they consider me a trouble maker,鈥� he said this year. 鈥淪o it is my duty to create more trouble.鈥� There was also 鈥渢rouble鈥� in China's north-western region of Xinjiang, where the Uighurs and majority Han Chinese clashed in July, causing some 200 deaths. The mainly Muslim Uighurs complain -- like many other minorities in China -- of cultural and religious repression. 2009 also marked the 20th anniversary of the massacre on Tiananmen Square, which can arguably be considered the most potent symbol of Chinese repression in the country鈥檚 recent past. The Chinese media were banned from discussing it. The British Human Rights Risk Atlas ranked China 12th 鈥渕ost risky country鈥� overall for human rights this year. For child labour, forced labour, and violations of freedom of association, discrimination and working conditions, China ranked highest. Liu Xiaobo is one of China's most prominent dissidents and is currently awaiting sentencing on charges of subversion. "I have lost faith,鈥� his wife Liu Xia said in August. 鈥淭here is absolutely no transparency here. If you live in a country in which freedom of speech isn鈥檛 worth a dime, anyone can be convicted.鈥� 鈥淚 am very worried,鈥� she continued. 鈥淭hey have accused him of felonies, for which he could receive up to 15 years in prison. He didn鈥檛 do anything, aside from telling the truth and stating his opinion. Here in China they call that 鈥榖reaking the law鈥�.鈥� Liu Xiaobo's sentence is expected to be handed down on Christmas day. Although China was criticised for its human rights record, its economic situation in 2009 gave rise to hope. Despite world recession, China鈥檚 economy continued to grow at a rate of eight to 10 percent. The optimism expressed by many economists at the beginning of the year seems to have been vindicated. 鈥淭he statistics are showing recovery in many sectors of the economy,鈥� the head of the Chinese Central Bank, Zhal Xiaochuan, said in January. 鈥淭his means that our economic stimulus programme is taking hold. The Chinese State Council has made it clear that our reaction to the crisis must be quick and resolute.鈥� The positive signs in China's economy have been attributed to an increase in Chinese consumerism and lending and investments abroad. With this strategy, experts say China is leading the world out of the financial crisis and will continue to do so in 2010. Author: Sarah BerningEditor: Anne Thomas
