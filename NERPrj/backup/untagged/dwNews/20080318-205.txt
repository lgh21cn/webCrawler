 Tibetans鈥� protests against Chinese rule have been reported widely in the Indian media. Editorials call for restraint by the Chinese authorities and criticize the New Delhi government for not speaking up for the Tibetans. They also cover the activities of the exile community in India in detail. 
 It is one thing to construct great wonders like the Lhasa railway, but quite another to meet the aspirations of the Tibetans. A great deal of Chinese policy is motivated by a morbid fear of China breaking up. Yet, almost every country in the world recognizes that Tibet is a part of China. What the Tibetans, or for that matter Uighurs of Xinjiang want is essentially to preserve their culture. A celebration of diversity will add to the glory of a great country like China, rather than detract from it. It is also noteworthy that unlike agitations by disaffected populations in other lands, where the gun quickly comes into play, the Tibetans鈥� strategy is largely Gandhian. This is true of the protests inside Tibet and China, as well as those by their compatriots living in exile in this country who began a march from Dharamsala, seat of the government-in-exile, to the Tibetan border. Some of them carried portraits not only of the Dalai Lama but also that of Mahatma Gandhi, as a mark of tribute to the land which has given them as well as their spiritual head refuge for the last 50 years. The Indian government is caught in a bit of a bind: New Delhi recognises that Tibet is a part of China, and has indeed given undertakings to Beijing that political activity directed against the People鈥檚 Republic would not be permitted from Indian soil. But at the same time this is a democracy, the world鈥檚 biggest as we so proudly proclaim, and the Indian people will find it hard to stomach any kind of brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrators in Lhasa. The ministry of external affairs has intoned that no 鈥渁nti-China鈥� activity will be permitted from Indian soil. It's an authoritarian trait to describe any protest as anti-national. India is a democracy. That principle isn't worth suspending just because Beijing is offended. Neither has it paid much dividend. Beijing's response to India's wholehearted backing of Chinese claims on Tibet and Taiwan has so far been meagre: recognition perhaps of India's claims on Sikkim, but not a settling of the boundary question in its entirety. China still continues to claim Arunachal Pradesh. It won't hurt if New Delhi were to say to Beijing that while it fully recognises Chinese claims over Tibet, it won't jail people who think otherwise. At the very least, India can be more supportive of the Dalai Lama鈥檚 call for Tibetan autonomy within China鈥檚 borders. The Dalai Lama鈥檚 restrained criticism of the Chinese crackdown in Lhasa has annoyed the Tibetan youth in India who now say his 鈥渕iddle way鈥� has become irrelevant. The Buddhist spiritual leader said the Beijing Olympics should not be called off. Radical youth groups that want the Games scrapped right away reacted with disappointment. The Tibetan Women鈥檚 Association too said the middle way, which it backed till recently, had 鈥渇ailed so far鈥�.
