 Over 140 people have been killed in riots in western China. Some 800 were injured and dozens were arrested on Sunday night. The Chinese state media said the numbers were likely to rise. A protest by Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region turned violent on Sunday night. 
 It was the bloodiest incident that Urumqi, in the autonomous region of Xinjiang, had seen in years. By the end of the clashes, over a hundred were dead and hundreds injured. Some 3,000 demonstrators had taken to the streets on Sunday to call for an investigation into a fight between Uyghurs and Han Chinese workers at a factory in southern China last month that left two people dead. There were eyewitness reports that police had opened fire and deployed armoured cars to disperse the protests on People's Square in Urumqi. Dozens found themselves behind bars when the police started rounding up alleged key figures. The government blamed Uyghur groups in exile for inciting violence. State television showed images of rioters setting fires to cars and clashing with police. On Monday, the governor of Xinjiang, Nuer Baikeli, made the following statement: 鈥淎fter the fight, some people incited others to go out onto the streets. Groups inside China used the Internet to call people to march onto Urumqi鈥檚 People鈥檚 Square. Some people did this on Sunday evening and demonstrated illegally. At the same time there were riots. Some uninformed civilians were also involved.鈥� The autonomous region of Xinjiang, in China鈥檚 extreme west, borders Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Russia. Just over eight million of the 19 million inhabitants are Uyghurs. Most of them are Muslim. Next to Tibet, Xinjiang is the region in China where the local ethnic minority is most dissatisfied. Supposedly to combat separatism and terrorism, the Chinese government has pursued a policy of mass immigration of Hans to the region over the past 50 years. The army has a strong presence. The local population claims it is discriminated against socially, culturally and economically. Beijing rejects such complaints by branding the Uyghur activists as separatist terrorists: 鈥淭he Chinese government has been trying to portray us as terrorists for years,鈥� explains Asgar Can, the vice president of the World Uyghur Congress in Munich. 鈥淟ast year, they said they had discovered a terrorist training camp. They should call for international observers and prove it. We think that the Chinese government is just staging it.鈥� On Monday, Dilxadi Rexiti, a spokesman for the Congress, also denied the government鈥檚 accusations that the protests in Urumqi had been orchestrated to incite violence: 鈥淭he official statements are unfounded. The Chinese government wants to justify its military measures against the Uyghurs who demonstrated peacefully.鈥� He also called on China to officially apologise for its oppressive policies against Uyghurs and insisted that their demands be heard. Meanwhile, the authorities said they had the city of Urumqi 鈥渦nder control鈥� on Monday. Police continued to patrol the streets, which were largely empty, as shops remained close.
