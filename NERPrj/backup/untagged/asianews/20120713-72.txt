 The camp not authorized. 70 students detained. President of ChinaAid underlines the continued violations of religious freedom against Protestants. In Muslim majority region those under 18 years of age can not practice any religion. 
 Beijing (AsiaNews / Agencies) - Chinese police have raided a Protestant Christian summer camp in the outskirts of Urumqi in Xinjiang. Authorities arrested seven teachers and detained 70 students. The incident occurred on July 2, but the news was released yesterday. Currently the seven educators are still in the detention center at Xishan. Bob Fu, president of ChinaAid, said the incident is just one of many in recent months. He tells of a real fury against house churches or schools for children run by Christians. In recent days, the police attacked the home of a minister of the district Shatain, confiscating material and documents, used to attack Christians. In June, another summer school was blocked by police in Houcun. Officers raided the property threatening the teachers, who were not allowed to teach religious education to children under the age of 18. In the Muslim majority region, you can join and practice a religion only after reaching the legal age.
