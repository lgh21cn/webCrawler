 Police violence in Urumqi is similar to that in Lhasa in March 2008. Beijing should draw some lessons from the Xinjiang riots, namely find a solution to the Tibetan question with the Dalai Lama. Tibet鈥檚 spiritual leader has urged his countrymen and women to use non-violence, but once he is dead Tibetan frustrations could turn into an uprising. 
 Daramshala (AsiaNews) 鈥� 鈥淭he policy of the Chinese government towards the Uyghurs is very similar to that towards the Tibetan people. Uyghurs and Tibetans suffer the same Chinese occupation; both of us are repressed and dominated and have to endure humiliations,鈥� saidUrgen Tenzin, executive director of the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) as he spoke toAsiaNews about China鈥檚 crackdown against protests in Urumqi and other Xinjiang cities. 鈥淗owever unlike the Uighur people, the people of Tibet have the spiritual and moral guidance of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who repeatedly emphasises and insists that all Tibetans follow the non-violent path for the resolution of the Tibetan issue.鈥� Current events in Xinjiang are very similar to what happened last year in Tibet. Demonstrations in Lhasa and other Tibetan regions turned into an uprising and violence against the Chinese military and ethnic Han Chinese.聽 Beijing in turn accused Tibetans of terrorism and of trying to disrupt the 2008 Olympics with violence. The accusation of violence 鈥渋s official Chinese propaganda. In March 2008 there was a global protest. Inspired by the Mahatma Gandhi and on the advice of the Dalai Lama it was supposed to be non-violent. Unfortunately, China鈥檚 propaganda machine created the impression that the protest was just violent. In fact, incidents that occurred after 14 March, when some Chinese-owned stores were set on fire and some ethnic Han Chinese were killed, were due to severe provocation. Chinese propaganda chose to show Tibetans鈥� 鈥榲iolence鈥�, but the world was able to see that Tibetan demonstrations were non-violent.鈥� According to Tenzin, China should draw some lessons from the demonstrations and violence in Urumqi. 鈥淭he frustrations of Tibetans are mounting; we are getting increasingly tired with Chinese insincerity in solving the Tibetan issue,鈥� Tenzin said. 鈥淏eijing should try to negotiate with the Dalai Lama and find a solution whilst he is still alive. None of us can predict what will happen after his death. So far he has preached and called for non-violence, but we do not know what will eventually happen. . . .鈥�
