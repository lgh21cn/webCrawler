 Tibetan monks, Xinjiang Muslims, but also non violent dissidents, farmers and members of underground religious communities are among those arrested. Youth crime climbs by 19.1 per cent. 
 Beijing (AsiaNews/SCMP)  China's courts were not idle in 2004. More than 800,000 people were arrested last year for endangering state security or for being involved in activities regarded as separatist, terrorist or extremist. In total, 811,102 people were held, an 8.3 per cent increase from 2003. The courts last year prosecuted 867,186 people in connection with those crimes. In his annual report to the National People's Congress (NPC), Jia Chunwang, head of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said that security situation in 2004 was "grave" requiring continuous efforts to crackdown on criminal activities. "[We were] resolute in smashing crimes which endanger state security and those criminal activities carried out by separatists, religious extremists and violent terrorists," Mr Jia told NPC members. Endangering state security is a term China's communist leaders use to detain people who oppose their rule and ideological control, including peaceful dissidents. Thousands of dissidents are jailed every year for allegedly endangering state security by engaging in pro-democracy activities or publishing essays on the internet that are seen as subversive. Tibetan monks and Xinjiang Muslims in northwest China who advocate independence are often targeted by Chinese authorities as terrorists, separatists or religious extremists. Clergymen and laity from underground Christian communities are also arrested for "endangering public order". Opposition to China's communist leadership is growing though, as a stark lack of economic opportunities among the country's 800 million rural dwellers becomes increasingly evident, raising fears of social unrest and turmoil. In his speech to the NPC on Saturday, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said dealing with simmering unrest was a key priority of his government this year, acknowledging the country faced "glaring" social problems. The Supreme People's Procuratorate also released data for corruption within the party. Courts heard 24,184 cases concerning officials last year, 5.2 per cent more than in 2003. Six ministerial-level officials and 772 officials above the county level were convicted of abusing power, bribery and embezzling public funds. The investigations helped recover 4.56 billion yuan ( 456 million, US$ 600 million) of state funds. The Chinese courts heard 644,248 criminal cases, with 767,951 people sentenced, up 1.5 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively from 2003. Criminal cases involving juveniles rose 19.1 per cent, with 70,086 young people sentenced. One of the areas to be highlighted by Mr Jia is the investigation into fake products. About 2,500 people were arrested and 2,124 charged with selling and producing fake milk powder, fake wine, fake medicine, fake fertiliser and fake pesticide last year, up 56 per cent from 2003.
