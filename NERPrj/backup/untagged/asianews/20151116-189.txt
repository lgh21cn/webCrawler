 Taking advantage of the Paris tragedy, the Chinese government wants to add Xinjiang Muslims on the terror lists. China鈥檚 national media try to link the attacks in the French capital with the country鈥檚 own "war on terror". International analysts are sceptical about any link between Islamist groups in China and the Islamic State. 
 Beijing (AsiaNews) 鈥� The struggle against Islamist militants in China鈥檚 far western region of Xinjiang should become an 鈥渋mportant part鈥� of the world鈥檚 war on terror, China鈥檚 foreign minister Wang Yi said following the attacks in Paris. Beijing has blamed the violence on Islamist militants, led by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM); a group it said had ties to al-Qaeda. More recently, China has reported that some Uyghurs have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamic State and other groups. Uyghurs are Muslim, Turkic-speaking, and the largest ethnic group in Xinjiang. They have given up on independence decades ago, but want Beijing to grant them greater cultural and religious autonomy. In recent years, violent attacks have targeted ethnic Han Chinese, who are China鈥檚 largest ethnic group, mostly by lone attackers unconnected to extremist movements active in the Middle East. Beijing has responded to rising violence with more repression, and has effectively militarised the province. In recent days, Chinese state media has already sought to link China鈥檚 own 鈥渨ar on terror鈥� with the Paris attacks. Over the weekend, pictures appeared on the microblogs of state-run newspapers showing Chinese armed police supposedly on a mission to root out militants in Xinjiang 鈥� pictures put out after what happened in France on Friday. For some experts, this is an attempt to justify future human rights violations at the expense of the indigenous Uyghur population. Conversely, for Foreign Minister Wang, 鈥淭he UN鈥檚 leading role should be brought into full play to combat terrorism, and a united front in this regard should be formed鈥�. In his view, 鈥淐hina is also a victim of terrorism, and cracking down on ETIM should become an important part of the international fight against terrorism鈥�.
