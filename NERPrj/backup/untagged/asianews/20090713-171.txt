 Official sources say police had to intervene to stop a brawl among Uyghurs. State media slam an 鈥渙rchestrated campaign鈥� for demonstrations in front of Chinese diplomatic missions. 
 Urumqi (AsiaNews/Agencies) 鈥� More unrest broke out in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang, scene of violence clashes in the past few days between the local Muslim Uyghur minority and Chinese security forces. Two ethnic Uyghur men were killed by police and a third one was injured. But China鈥檚 official media continue to claim that violence is caused by an 鈥渙rchestrated campaign鈥� which is also responsible for demonstrations in front Chinese embassies in Europe and the United States. A spokesman for the Xinjiang Autonomous Region said that police had to move in today to stop an attack by three Uyghurs against a fourth one. During their intervention police shot two men to death and seriously injured a third. Unofficial sources claim that police fired at a group of Uyghurs armed with knives and rods who had attacked the police. In the meantime Urumqi remains under tight police control. Police issued new measures to enforce law and order. They include a ban on carrying knives and sticks in the street, shouting slogans, waving banners or handing out flyers. In Turkey, Norway, Germany and the Netherlands demonstrators threw eggs, Molotov cocktails and stones at Chinese embassies and consulates. Xinhua, China鈥檚 official news agency, reported that unrest in Xinjiang and protests in front of China鈥檚 diplomatic missions appeared 鈥渨ell-orchestrated鈥� by 鈥渟upporters of the East Turkestan鈥�. It blamed the unrest on the World Uyghur Congress, an organisation that represents Uyghurs outside of China. The official death toll stands at 184, including 137 ethnic Han Chinese and 46 Muslim Uyghurs. About 1,700 people were injured. Dissident groups in exile claim instead that hundreds of Muslims died during the clashes.
