 Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) 鈥� Chinese police yesterday defended an attack against what they have described as a training camp run by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). The authorities said the police raid was within the limits of international and domestic law. 聽 Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Liu Jianchao told a press conference that 鈥渢he camp was linked to international terrorism鈥� but he gave no proof to substantiate his allegation. 聽 Eighteen alleged terrorists were killed and 17 arrested in the attack on 8 January in the northern Xinjiang province. A police official was killed in the clash and another was wounded. 聽 The training camp is located in the Pamir Plateau in one of the highest altitudes of the region that bordersPakistan, Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan. 聽 Ministry of Public Security spokesman Wu Heping said: 鈥淭he United Nations had identified the ETIM as a terrorist group onSeptember 11, 2002. These activists have been on a list of Chinese most-wanted people sinceDecember 15, 2003.鈥� 聽 He continued: 鈥淭he criteria and legal basis for identifying terrorists are defined by our criminal law, internal security demands and by the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation's Shanghai Convention on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism.鈥� 聽 On this basis, 鈥淐hinese police will continue to closely monitor the situation, use force, strengthen international co-operation and crack down on the crimes of any terrorists and their groups. It must do so to maintain the stability of border areas and to protect the lives of those living there.鈥� 聽 However, groups lobbying for human rights groups in China have accused Beijing of using the war on terror as a cover for its violent crackdown on separatist movements.
