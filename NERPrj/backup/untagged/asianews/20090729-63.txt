 Accused by Beijing of masterminding the violence in Xinjiang, Uyghur leader calls for an international inquiry to see who was behind the clashes and deaths in Urumqi. China says US agrees the matter is an internal Chinese matter. Beijing criticises Japan and Australia for hosting Kadeer. 
 Tokyo (AsiaNews/Agencies) 鈥� Exiled Uyghur dissident Rebiya Kadeer accused China today of trying to lay a veil of silence over the disappearance of 鈥渁bout 10,000 people鈥� during the unrest in Urumqi, Xinjiang. The head of the World Uyghur Congress has also reproached the United States for its silence over the matter as well. Ms Kadeer arrived yesterday in the Japanese capital to urge the international community to provide support to her people, 鈥渕assacred鈥� by the Chinese. 鈥淎bout 10,000 people disappeared in Urumqi in one night. Where have they gone? If they are dead, where are they鈥� now, she said during a press conference through an interpreter. In early July protests by Uyghurs in Urumqi turned into clashes with police and ethnic Han Chinese.聽 According to the Chinese government 197 people died as a result of the violence, mostly Han Chinese. Uyghur dissidents claim instead that thousands of people have probably died. Beijing has accused the World Uyghur Congress of masterminding the unrest and has labelled Ms Kadeer the 鈥渂lack hand鈥� that seeks the independence of Xinjiang with the help of 鈥渢errorists鈥�. The Uyghur leader has dismissed these charges and always rejected appeals from al-Qaeda to resort to violence. Instead she believes Chinese police and government are responsible for the clashes. 鈥淭he responsibility lies with the authorities who transformed what had been a peaceful demonstration into violent unrest,鈥� she said. The dissident leader also called for an international inquiry into the demonstrations and clashes. Ms Kadeer said she was 鈥減erplexed and disappointed鈥� by the 鈥渃ool response of the United States鈥� towards the Xinjiang problem. 鈥淚 would like to believe that the United States will not remain impassive,鈥� she said. She also urged the US administration to open a consulate in Urumqi. Yesterday after two days of Sino-American economic talks, Wang Guangya, China's vice foreign minister,thanked the United States for taking a "moderate" line on recent ethnic violence in Xinjiang. 鈥淭he United States unequivocally said that this incident is entirely a domestic affair of China,鈥� he said. By contrast, China criticised Japan for granting Ms Kadeer a visa. Some news agencies have reported that Beijing has blocked Japanese TV programmes reporting the arrival of the Uyghur leader. After Japan, Kadeer is expected to travel to Australia for the premiere of a film on her life. Even on this occasion Chinese authorities have tried everything in the power to have the movie pulled from theMelbourne International Film Festival which will be held next month.
