Another/O reason/O for/O Russia/LOCATION support/O of/O Syria/LOCATION is/O Moscow/LOCATION 's/O fear/O that/O radical/O Islamists/O would/O dominate/O a/O post-Assad/O Syria/LOCATION ./O 
China/LOCATION has/O pursued/O a/O course/O of/O economic/O expansion/O for/O years/O ./O

That/O 's/O why/O Beijing/LOCATION is/O trying/O to/O increase/O its/O influence/O in/O the/O Middle/LOCATION East/LOCATION ./O 
China/LOCATION 's/O strongest/O ties/O are/O with/O Iran/LOCATION ./O 
But/O like/O Russia/LOCATION ,/O China/LOCATION is/O banking/O that/O Assad/PERSON will/O stay/O in/O power/O ./O 
The/O Chinese/O government/O has/O justified/O its/O veto/O in/O the/O UN/ORGANIZATION Security/ORGANIZATION Council/ORGANIZATION by/O saying/O it/O respects/O Syria/LOCATION 's/O right/O to/O handle/O its/O affairs/O without/O outside/O intervention/O ./O

If/O the/O Chinese/O government/O backed/O intervention/O in/O Syria/LOCATION ,/O it/O would/O likely/O face/O more/O criticism/O for/O its/O own/O policies/O back/O home/O ./O 
EU/ORGANIZATION member/O countries/O have/O maintained/O rather/O discrete/O ties/O with/O the/O Assad/PERSON regime/O over/O the/O years/O ./O 
The/O Syrian/O leadership/O tried/O to/O appear/O distant/O from/O the/O west/O ,/O but/O kept/O up/O pragmatic/O ,/O economic/O relations/O with/O the/O EU/LOCATION ./O
