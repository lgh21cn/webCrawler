Urumqi (AsiaNews/Agencies) - More than 200 people were arrested and 23 
extremist groups broken, state media report after Chinese authorities launched 
a massive campaign in Xinjiang province, following anattack at Urumqi railway 
station 

 on Thursday that left 34 people dead.

According to the Xinhua news agency, police arrested many suspects in their 
20s and 30s since Friday.

They learnt how to make explosives through the internet and undertook physical 
training by watching online videos. Equally, they used text messages and social 
media to chat about how to make explosives and spread "jihad".

During their crackdown, police also seized more than 200 explosive devices. 
For the authorities, those responsible for the spread of Islamic extremism are 
all ethnic Uighurs, with contacts in Turkmenistan. All those arrested were also 
Uighurs.

For years, Xinjiang, a region inhabited by the Uyghur, a Turkic Muslim ethnic 
minority, has been rocked by riots and tensions. The Uighurs accuse Beijing of 
colonising their homeland and demand greater autonomy.

The government, which has moved millions of ethnic Han Chinese settlers to 
Xinjiang and boosted its military presence, has accuses Uighurs of separatism 
and Islamic terrorism.

In order to end the violence, the authorities have been quick to impose the 
death penalty and have denied local Muslims their religious freedom.

In a previous incident at the end of April, two suspected suicide bombers 
detonated explosives at the exit to the Urumqi train station 

, killing themselves and one other person. Another eight people attacked 
passengers with knives, leaving 79 injured.

The violence came just a few hours after President Xi Jinping ended his visit 
to the region.

In recent months, attacks with bombs and knives have also occurred in 
Guangzhou and Kunming, which the government don Islamic separatists in Xinjiang.
