Cairo (AsiaNews/Agencies) – Al-Azhar, the leading Muslim seat of learning, 
condemned China for imposing restrictions on fasting inXinjiang 

 during the holy month of Ramadan.

Based in Egypt, the Sunni institution has called on Beijing to allow the 
Muslim community in the province to observe the fast and participate in 
religious activities during the holy month.

Out of Xinjiang’s 22 million people, almost nine million are indigenous Muslim 
Uighurs. Deemed a hotbed of terrorism, the region has seen rising tensions due 
to Beijing’s restrictive ethnic and religious policies.

Over the years, clashes and violent incidents have broken out between native 
Uighurs and ethnic Han Chinese settlers brought in by the Chinese government to 
swamp the indigenous population.

“Al-Azhar and its grand imam, Ahmed Al-Tayeb (pictured), condemn the Chinese 
authorities’ ban on Muslims from fasting and practicing their religious rituals 
during Ramadan in some parts of the western Xinjiang region,” said a statement 
from the Cairo-based Al-Azhar.

“Al-Azhar rejects all forms of oppression practiced against Uighur Muslims in 
China that affect their religious rights and personal freedoms,” said the 
prestigious institution, which called on the international community, the 
United Nations and human rights groups to end these violations.
