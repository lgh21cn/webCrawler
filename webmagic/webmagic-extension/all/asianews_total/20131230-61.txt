Beijing (AsiaNews) - The authorities in China's predominantly Muslim Uyghur 
northwestern province of Xinjiang planned to force six native women to undergo 
an abortion for "violating" the government's one-child policy.

Despite the new policy by the central government, easing the one-child policy, 
doctors in Hotan Prefecture injected the women with a drug to induce 
miscarriage.

"We had planned to perform forced abortions on six women. Four of them have 
already undergone the abortions," said Momin, deputy chief of Hotan's Arish 
Township.

"One more woman is waiting in hospital to undergo the abortion while another 
woman has escaped before undergoing the process," Momin added.

Awat Han, head of the family planning department in Arish Township, told RFA 
that four forced abortions were carried out over the last week, saying she was 
only following orders from higher authorities.

In November, the Plenum of the Communist Party announced reforms in family 
planning. Under the new rules, formally approved by the Standing Committee of 
the National People's Congress on 28 December 

, couples who are only children can have two children.

When it comes to national minorities, China's demographic policies has not 
changed; minority couples can have two children under certain circumstances.

Although "My wife was injected by a doctor," said Memettursun Kawul, the 
husband of one of the women forced to abort, "My son was crying when he was 
born."

When he heard the cries of his son and wife, Kawul then stormed into the 
delivery room, grabbed the baby and took him to a nearby hospital in a bid to 
save him.

"The doctors in the hospital tried to save him but they failed, citing the 
abortion drug that had already been injected. My son died an hour after he was 
born."
