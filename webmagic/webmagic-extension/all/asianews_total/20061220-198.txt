Islamabad (AsiaNews) – China “is ready to conduct an anti-terrorism drive in 
Asia withPakistan for lasting peace and mutual prosperity”, said the Chinese 
General Lu Dengming, Chief of Staff of the Chendu military region. He was 
speaking at the concluding session of 10 days of joint military exercises 
betweenPakistan and China.

The general said: “For many years Pakistan and China have remained focused on 
economic development and regional stability; at the same time we are 
confronting three evil forces – terrorism, extremism and separatism.”

In such a scenario, “the whole world must benefit each other and enhance 
cooperation to combat these evils.Beijing is against all forms of terrorism and 
insists on international cooperation and the conducting of anti-terrorism 
campaigns.”

Li said the Pakistani army is “highly professional: it has advanced 
technological arms and dedicated troops. We were impressed by the high quality 
of the exercises.”

The statements made by the Pakistani Corps Commander, General Tariq Majid, 
were in the same vein. He told a press conference: “Our country andChina have 
many shared enemies: standing united, we can eliminate the menace of terrorism, 
which is affecting the entire fabric of human society.” The issue of terrorism 
is keenly felt byBeijing that is trying in all ways possible to prevent what it 
calls “popular uprisings” in the northern region of Xinjiang, the homeland of 
the ethnic Uighurs of Muslim faith.

The region borders Afghanistan, Pakistan, Russia, Mongolia and three ex-Soviet 
Republics of centralAsia.  Many human rights activists insist “terrorism” is 
used as an excuse by the Communist government to persecute the Uighur minority.

The decision to hold the exercises was taken during the visit in Pakistan of 
the Chinese president Hu Jintao and they follow another set held inChina in 
2004. The recent drills were unique because they marked the first time Chinese 
troops left their country to do exercises abroad.

Beijing is the main supplier of conventional arms to Pakistan but many 
analysts claim the Chinese government also backsIslamabad’s nuclear and missile 
programmes.
