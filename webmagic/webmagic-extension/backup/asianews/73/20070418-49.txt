Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) – A court in Urumqi (Xinjiang) sentenced Ablikim 
Abdiriyim, a son of exiled Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer, for nine years 
yesterday, for instigating and engaging in secessionist activities in the 
region. Ms Kadeersaid charges against her son were false and that he was tried 
without legal assistance.

The court convicted Abdureyim of spreading secessionist articles over the 
internet, instigating the public against the government and writing articles 
that distorted China's human rights and ethnic policies. Under Chinese law, he 
will also be denied political rights for three years, rights which include free 
speech and the ability to gather or protest.

Amnesty International reported last month that Ablikim was ill from beatings 
suffered in detention and was being denied access to medical treatment.

Rebiya Kadeer, a Muslim ethnic Uighur and a prominent businesswoman, fell from 
grace for criticising the communist government's treatment of Xingjian’s Uighur 
community. Arrested in 1999 on her way to meet US congressmen, she was 
eventually released and allowed to leave for the United States in 2005 where 
she now heads the Uighur American Association

"They would not appoint a lawyer for him and didn't give him an opportunity to 
defend himself, and they held the hearing in secret," Ms Kadeer told the
Washington Post.

Another son, Alim Abdureyim, was sentenced to seven years in prison in 
September of last year on tax evasion charges.

And another son was convicted of tax evasion but spared a jail term whilst a 
daughter has been placed under house arrest.
