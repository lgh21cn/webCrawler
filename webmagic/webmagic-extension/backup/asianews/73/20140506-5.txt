Guangzhou ( AsiaNews / Agencies ) - At least six people were injured this 
morning in a train station in Guangzhou (southern province of Guangdong) by a 
group of men armed with knives. The police shot one of the attackers, according 
to information provided the city's public security bureau. At the moment there 
are no details on what happened, nor the reasons for the attack , which took 
place five days after the attack on theUrumqi 

 train station, in the western region of Xinjiang.

 A picture published on the website of People's Daily shows a crowd of people 
evacuated and an ambulance at the scene. The six injured were taken to hospital 
for further treatment and investigations are still ongoing.

 This is the third attack in a train station in the country, after the ones in 
Kunming 

 andUrumqi 

. Beijing considers the separatists in Xinjiang -  home to the Uyghur, an 
ethnic Turkic speaking peoples who profess Islam - responsible for both.

 The province is one of the most turbulent in all of China: The Uyghurs have 
always tried to gain independence from Beijing, who in turn have sent in the 
millions of Han Chinese to try to make them the dominant ethnic group . In 
addition, the central government imposes severe restrictions on religious 
freedom, the practice of Islam, the teaching of the local language and culture.
