Washington (AsiaNews/Agencies) - A bipartisan group of 119 US lawmakers urged 
President George W. Bush on Monday to raise with President Hu Jintao the case 
of an imprisoned prominent Chinese pro-democracy activist.

Yang Jianli, a US permanent resident, was detained by the Chinese government 
in April 2002 when entering the country with a friend's passport after Beijing 
refused to renew his own due to his involvement in the 1989 Tiananmen Square 
protests.

"We believe that your personal, direct advocacy with President Hu at this 
crucial time is our best and greatest hope in helping to bring Yang Jianli, who 
is a hero to so many, home," the legislators from the US House of 
Representatives said in the letter to Mr Bush.

The House and Senate have unanimously passed several resolutions calling for 
Yang's unconditional release. Mr Bush had raised Mr Yang's case with Mr Hu 
during his visit to Beijing in November and as well when he met the Chinese 
leader at a UN summit in New York in September last year, according to rights 
groups informed of diplomatic attempts to seek his release.

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also raised the matter several times with 
her Chinese counterpart, while the US embassy brought his plight to Beijing's 
attention more than 60 times, they said.

Mr Yang was initially held for more than a year in solitary confinement 
without access to counsel, and was reportedly abused by prison guards. He 
suffered a minor stroke, and "his health continues to be a serious concern to 
many of us," the lawmakers said in the letter.
