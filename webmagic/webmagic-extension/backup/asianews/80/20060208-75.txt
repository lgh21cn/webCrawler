Urumqi (AsiaNews/RFA)  Chinese authorities have banned government officials, 
state employees (on active duty or retired), Communist Party members, youth 
league members, minors and women from entering mosques. Such signs, written in 
Uyghura language which uses the Arabic alphabet and is frowned upon by the 
authoritieswere first posted in mosques in the southern and poorest parts of 
the region.

The measure is part of a vast campaign by the Communist Party against a local 
revival in religious practice, especially amongst its members.

An article published last November in Hong Kong-based social affairs journal 
Zhengming ('Debates') reported that across the country more than one in three 
Party members have become involved in religious activities, usually in secret. 
China's Communist Party has almost 20 million members.

After denying that there was any ban, an imam at the Heitkar mosque in Kashgar 
confirmed that that it did exist. The imam, who preferred not to reveal his 
identity, said that it was the "same here in our Heitkar mosque. Our policies 
are all same".

Several Uyghur Muslims confirmed that members of certain groups were not 
allowed to go to the mosque even for major festivals such asEid al-Fitr at the 
end of the fasting month of Ramadan, orEid al-Adha when sheep and goats are 
sacrificed to recall the sparing of Abraham's son Isaac.

A farmer added that government officials keep tight guard over mosques, noting 
who comes and who leaves, and issuing fines of up to 5,000 yuan (US$ 620,  
500) to those who break the ban.

He mentioned the case of a schoolteacher jailed for two years and fired after 
20 years' service for persisting in performing her five daily prayers as 
required of each Muslim.

"If an imam does not do what the government says, he is taken away and the 
government appoints a new one who will," he said.

Known as East Turkistan till 1955, Xinjiang is currently an Autonomous Region. 
Uyghurs, who are mostly Muslim, are the largest ethnic group in a population of 
19 million. The oil-rich territory was independent until Chinese Communist 
takeover.
