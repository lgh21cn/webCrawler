Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) – The information office of China’s State Council 
has recently issued a white paper claiming that Muslims in China’s northwestern 
province of Xinjiang have freedom unparalleled in other parts of the country.

“No resident has received discrimination or unjust treatment based on their 
religious or lack of religious belief,” the paper says. However, analysts 
contend that discrimination and prejudice are the normal state of affairs for 
Muslims.

Xinjiang is one of China’s most turbulent provinces. It is home to about 9 
million Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim and Turkic ethnic group that has always 
sought independence from China.

For its part, China’s central government has pursued a policy of settling 
ethnic Han Chinese in the province to make them the majority and thus quell 
social unrest. This has meant serious restrictions on religious freedom, 
Islamic practices, as well as the local language and culture.

On several occasions, Chinese authorities have prevented or restricted Ramadan 
fasting, banned beards, raided mosques, and searched the homes of Muslim 
clerics, to monitor potential “terrorism”.

Since 2009, the province has been under a special regime giving extra powers 
to police and army after clashesleft nearly 200 people dead 

. The crackdown that followed the violence resulted in hundreds of prison 
sentences and dozens of death penalties.

Chinese authorities blamed the violence on Muslim extremists, but Uighur 
exiles say that Beijing is exaggerating the threat of Islamic terrorism to 
justify repression against the local population.

None of this is true according to the white paper, which claims that freedom 
of religious belief in Xinjiang today “cannot be matched by that in any other 
historical period, and is undeniable to anyone who respects the facts”.

Yet, China’s “lies could not cover up the truth” about its openly restrictive 
and prohibitive religious policies, said Dilxat Rexit, spokesman for the World 
Uighur Congress in Germany.
