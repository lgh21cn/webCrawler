 Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) – Chinese authorities have sentenced to death four 
ethnic Uygur accused of terrorism, but activists believe the condemned did not 
receive a fair trial.

 The four were found guilty on Wednesday for allegedly setting up and running 
terrorist organisations, illegally making explosives, murder and arson. Two 
others were jailed for 19 years.

 Sentences stem from three terrorist attacks following a harsh crackdown in 
July by Chinese authorities (see “Xinjiang, Chinese police kill dozens of 
Uyghurs,” inAsiaNews 

, 19 July 2011, and “More deaths in Xinjiang, Beijing announces tough measures 
during Ramadan,” InAsiaNews 

, 1 August 2011).

 Beijing blamed such attacks on “terrorists” but according to the Uyghurs, 
police violence transformed peaceful demonstrations into clashes with security 
forces.

 A spokesman for the World Uygur Congress, a Germany-based exile group, said 
that the suspects did not receive a fair trial.

 He accuses Chinese authorities of torturing the prisoners and denying them 
the right to choose their own lawyers. Government assigned attorney were able 
to meet their clients just an hour before trial.

 Beijing continues to justify its iron fist in its westernmost region by 
accusing the Uyghurs of extremism, separatism and terrorism. For Chinese 
authorities, local radical Muslims are tied to al Qaeda.

 In reality, Uyghurs want political and economic autonomy, accusing Beijing of 
colonising their region.

 The crackdown by China’s central authorities extends to the practice of 
religion. For instance, minors are not allowed to go to the mosque, whilst 
imams and Qur‘anic schools are controlled.
