<\TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
Beijing says it is a conspiracy against its power. The Uyghurs say the uprising is a sign of dissatisfaction with the Han colonization and political and economic repression. A similar scheme to that of Tibetan revolts last year. China prepares for 60 years of the founding of the People's Republic with a crackdown.

 Urumqi (AsiaNews / Agencies) - Violence and clashes between demonstrators, the 
Chinese army and police in the capital of Xinjiang last night have resulted in 
at least 140 dead and 800 wounded. The official Xinhua agency reports this 
morning that all is calm. The police has already arrested hundreds of 
demonstrators, but is searching for 10 important leaders of the revolt.


The government has declared that the instigators of violence are exiled 
Uygurs, including Rebiya Kadeer, exiled after spending years in Chinese 
prisons. Members of the community of exiled Uyghurs claim that the 
demonstration had begun peacefully and that the police fired indiscriminately 
on the crowd.

According to some local witnesses, yesterday evening, between 2 and 3 thousand 
Uygurs, the Muslim ethnic group living in Xinjiang, gathered in the streets in 
central Urumqi, and clashed with at least 1000police. Police charged the crowd, 
firing on them and dispersing protesters who went on to break windows and burn 
cars and buses. To date, Urumqi is under a strict curfew.

The demonstrators said they wanted to demonstrate against their 
marginalisation by the Han (Chinese) population that in Xinjiang and throughout 
China controls the local economy and administration.

More precisely, they were protesting the death of two Uygurs in southern 
China, in a series of cashes between workers from the two ethnic groups.

According to Xinhua, the clashes occurred in Shaoguan (Guangdong), and were 
caused by a false accusation of rape of workers in Xinjiang. It should be noted 
that the lack of a labour force in south China, has forced Beijing to 
facilitate the emigration of ethnic Han people towards the coast. But this has 
given rise to difficulties and increased competition for jobs, particularly as 
many Chinese firms, hit by the crisis, lay off their workers.

 Revolts over work and unemployment are on the increase. According to the 
Ministry for Internal Security, there are at least 87 thousand a year. If the 
crisis deepens, there is a risk that this type of trade union struggle will 
turn into an inter-ethnic war.

Uprisings in Xinjiang date back over half a century. The Uygur population 
claim more autonomy from the central government and groups of Muslims in the 
Islamic Movement of East Turkistan are responsible for terrorist attacks.

The Beijing regime’s heavy hand can be seen in the large number of arrests and 
death sentences, which number in their hundreds each year. In order to curb 
"terrorism", Beijing controls the entire religious life of the Uygurs: 
controlling the speeches of imams, banning young people from participating in 
prayer in the mosque until they are 18, the continued demolition of mosques and 
Islamic schools.

According to Forum 18, a Protestant agency based in Oslo, religious 
persecution in Xinjiang has primarily economic reasons and is intended to stamp 
out the identity of the Uygurs and expropriate the areas wealth in oil and 
natural gas. Because of this, over the years Beijing has promoted migration to 
the region of millions of Han Chinese, who are now at least 50% of the 
approximately 20 million residents: they have taken control of trade and places 
of power, while the Uygurs (42%) are mainly farmers.

The Chinese government attaches all responsibilities for the uprising to 
groups of exiled Uygurs and in particular to Rebiya Kadeer, now exiled in the 
United States, after spending over 5 years in prison for having defended the 
greater autonomy of his ethnicity. According toXinhua, yesterday’s 
demonstration was “an organized and premeditated violent crime" to overthrow 
the power of the Chinese.

But the Uygurs in exile claim that the demonstrations are a sign of the Uygurs 
intolerance of Han political and economic discrimination and oppression. 
Experts fromHuman Rights Watch say that in labelling the ethnic clashes 
"subversive”, the Chinese government is adopting a method already used and 
abused in the uprisings in Tibet last year.

Uygurs and human rights activists’ fear that in the coming days there will be 
an increase in repression: there have already been raids and arrests in the 
universities. China is preparing for October to celebrate 60 years of the 
founding of the Peoples Republic of China and is implementing heavy checks and 
arrests to avoid any unpleasant surprises.
