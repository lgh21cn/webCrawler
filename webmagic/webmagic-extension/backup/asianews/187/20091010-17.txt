Urumqi (AsiaNews / Agencies) - A man of Han ethnicity was sentenced to death 
and another to life imprisonment for killing two Uyghur workers, which occurred 
in June in Shaoguan, Guangdong Province.

The City Court has sentenced nine other ethnic Han with between five and eight 
years in prison, all involved in the assassination of two immigrants who worked 
in a factory in the South.

Han workers had accused the two Uyghurs immigrants, from Xinjiang, of violence 
against two women also employed in the factory. The group of Han then beat the 
two Muslim workers with sticks and rods, killing them, and sparking clashes 
between workers of the two ethnic groups.

Following the events of Shaoguan thousands of Uyghurs took to the streets of 
Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang, to protest against the murder and the 
marginalization they endured. The Han population in Xinjiang has in hand the 
economy and the local administration. On the night of July 6th Army and the 
Chinese police dealt with the demonstrators, causing at least 200 Muslims 
deaths, 800 wounded and arresting hundreds of protesters. The violent response 
by Chinese police sparked strong international criticism against Beijing.
