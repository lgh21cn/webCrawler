Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) – China has banned civil servants, students and 
teachers in its Xinjiang region – home to a large Muslim community – from 
fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

The authorities have ordered restaurants to stay open. In some counties, 
religious vigils and activities associated with the month have been banned.

Out of Xinjiang’s 22 million people, almost nine million are indigenous Muslim 
Uighurs. Deemed a hotbed of terrorism, the region has seen rising tensions due 
to Beijing’s restrictive ethnic and religious policies.

Over the years, clashes and violent incidents have broken out between native 
Uighurs and ethnic Han Chinese settlers brought in by the Chinese government to 
swamp the indigenous population.

Going one step beyond simply discouraging government employees to forgo 
fasting, police and court officials in Awat County were ordered to “take the 
lead in teaching family members not to fast and not to participate in 
Ramadan-related religious activities”.

As in previous years, teachers and schoolchildren were included in directives 
limiting Ramadan fasting and other religious observances.

However, for Dilxat Rexit, a spokesman for the exiled World Uygur Congress, 
“Policies that prohibit religious fasting are a provocation and will only lead 
to instability and conflict.”
