Urumqi (AsiaNews) Â– The authorities of the northern province of Xinjiang 
yesterday arrested a Korean-born Protestant pastor and 35 unofficial Christians 
of Yongfeng who had gathered for bible study. This was reported by the China 
Aid Association (CAA), a US-based non-governmental organization lobbying for 
religious freedom in China.

The police raided 'Mountain Villa' in Qilin, a suburb of the provincial 
capital, Uramqi, when some Christians were attending a bible training program 
by a Korean pastor from America. During the raid, the police confiscated bibles 
and "other Christian material". The detainees are being kept in an unknown 
location.

CAA said the names of some of the arrested were Zhou Li, Xia Lingzhi, Bao Lin, 
Ren Baolan, Feng Yan, Hu Ying, adding that the first two had already been 
arrested and fined last year "for attending a Christian service".

The association said: "Xia Lingzhi is 66 years old. She suffers from coronary 
heart disease and high blood pressure and thus should not be detained again as 
her life would be at risk."
