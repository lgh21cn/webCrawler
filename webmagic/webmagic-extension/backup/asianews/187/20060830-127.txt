Urumqi (AsiaNews/SCMP) Â– China's supplies of a rare jade, mainly mined from a 
river in Xinjiang, will soon be exhausted if excessive exploitation continues, 
a gem expert warned.

Wang Shiqi, deputy director of Peking University's Gemstone Appraisal Centre, 
said deposits of Khotan, or Hotan, jade would be depleted in five or six years 
if the government did not stop the indiscriminate use of heavy excavation 
machinery along Xinjiang's Yurungkax River, the main source of the stone.

The jade is considered to be the highest quality because of its pure texture 
and tallow-like lustre, and has been associated with emperors throughout 
Chinese history.

Khotan jade can sell for up to 1,000 yuan a gram (about 100 euros or 120 
dollars US), and prices have rocketed in recent years because of a sharp 
decrease in output.

The Xinhua news agency reports that prospectors with modern mining equipment 
have flooded into the region to capitalise on the gemstone's high prices.

According to one jade miner, "there are about 200,000 people and about 2,000 
excavators working along the Yurungkax River."

Hotan jade trader Zheng Shengli said he thought the jade would be depleted in 
no more than three years, noting that "about half of the machines have stopped 
running now because no gemstones can be found."
