Beijing (AsiaNews / Agencies) - Chinese authorities have tightened security 
after a series of demonstrations seeking justice for the deaths of two ethnic 
Mongols. Hundreds of policemen were deployed at various points of Hohhot, the 
capital of the province, schools and universities are under under surveillance 
and many young people can not leave the campus. The internet has been blocked 
and news searches on Mongolia are obscured.

Tensions escalated after the death of two people in two separate incidents. 
The first occurred on May 10, a Mongolian shepherd was hit by a truck, driven 
by a Han Chinese, carrying minerals through the pastures, ruining the grass and 
the work of shepherds.

On May 15, another ethnic Mongolian, was killed during a protest in front of a 
mine.The Mongols, a minority in their homeland, accuse the government and its 
mining policy of destroying the pastures, polluting the land and destroying the 
peace.

The ethnic Mongolians are only 20% out of a population of 24 million. In 
recent years, the exploitation of coal and rare mineral mines has increased in 
Inner Mongolia, which are highly polluting. The boom has brought workers from 
other parts of China and Mongolia, mainly devoted to sheep farming, is now a 
threatened minority, their work is also likely to be destroyed due to mining 
and pollution.

In recent days there have been demonstrations that have gathered thousands of 
ethnic Mongolians in the capital and several other cities. Analysts say they 
are more numerous than demonstrations over the past 20 years.

To calm the public, the government has promised to prosecute the two Chinese 
responsible for the deaths of two Mongols. Yesterday,Xinhua reported that a 
Chinese man was tried for the death of Yan Wenlong, an ethnic Mongolian man 
killed during protests at the mine.

According to analysts, the riots in Inner Mongolia are similar to those in 
Tibet and Xinjiang, where the Tibetan and Uighur minorities are fighting for 
their survival. TheGlobal Times today (linked to the tabloid People’s Daily) 
has now put on guard by the attempt to give meaning to political events in 
Mongolia.

" The Mongolian protests - says the newspaper - are not a politically-driven 
demonstration. Some of their requests are reasonable, and should be responded 
to by the local government”. But it rejected as “improper” any link between the 
situation in the region bordering Mongolia and outbursts of ethnic turmoil in 
Tibet in 2008 and in the remote northwestern region of Xinjiang in 2009.
“Social conflicts are on the rise in China and ethnic minority areas are no 
exception. But the incidents there should not be exaggerated or 
over-interpreted,” it said.
