Beijing ( AsiaNews / Agencies) - In the annual attempt to prevent any 
commemoration of the Tiananmen massacre, the police have arrested the statesman 
Bao Tong. So far at least 80 people have been detained or isolated for being 
linked to some events related to the 25th anniversary of the violent 
suppression of the students and workers movement.

Bao Tong, who is now 81 years of age (pictured), was an aide to Party 
secretary Zhao Ziyang at the time of the massacre. Both opposed to the military 
intervention to "clear" the square of the sit-in that had been going on for 
weeks. But the decision was taken by Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng. Zhao and Bao 
were arrested, and the tanks arrived in Tiananmen Square, killing and crushing 
the young people gathered there. Since then, Bao has spent seven years in 
prison and decades under house arrest, even if the Party has allowed him 
occasionally to meet with foreign journalists for interviews or comments on 
current events.

Bao Tong's son, Bao Pu, says he does not know where his father was taken and 
is unable to trace his whereabouts. This is the first time that his father has 
been sequestered by the police. "In the past - he explains - the authorities 
asked him to leave his home [in Beijing] around June 1, but they never forced 
him to. This year they took him away".

 In other years, Bao took a "forced vacation" traveling to Jiangsu or 
Zhejiang, to keep him away from the capital and from possible commemorations of 
the anniversary.

The Chinese Communist Party maintains that the students of the non-violent 
movement who  called for democracy and an end to corruption were 
"counter-revolutionaries". In recent years it has done everything possible to 
erase the memory of the massacre, even to the point of  justifying it as a 
"lesser evil" to save the country's economic development . But each year 
associations - such as the Tiananmen Mothers, parents whose children were 
killed - activists and intellectuals, plead for some clarity on the event and a 
change in the judgment on the movement which was inherently "patriotic" in 
nature.

 In doing so the Party would have to admit its mistakes so it prefers to 
suffocate, stop and isolate those who dare to keep the memory alive.

According to the CHRD (China Human Rights Defenders) this year at least 80 
people, including activists, human rights lawyers, academics and Christians 
have been arrested, isolated or brought in for questioning.

 In an attempt to present themselves as the best of all possible governments, 
the Chinese Communist Party has undertaken to re-write (and clean-up) its 
history, hiding purges, violence and disasters caused by the folly of its 
leaders and its monopoly of power.

It is even impossible to find out how many young people lost their lives 
beneath the tanks in Tiananmen. The Beijing authorities have never released an 
official list. In the aftermath of the massacre, the Chinese Red Cross had 
declared at least 2600 dead, but later retracted his statements. Human rights 
organizations estimate that between 200 and 2 thousand were killed in the 
square, in the side streets and in the days following June 4.
