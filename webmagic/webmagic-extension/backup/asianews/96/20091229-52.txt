Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) – Five more Uyghurs have been sentenced to death 
for their role in protests that broke out in Xinjiang, but Chinese authorities 
have tried to keep the news from both domestic and international media. 
“Altogether 22 defendants in five cases went on trial December 22- 23,” Hou 
Hanmin, director of the Xinjiang Government Information Office, was quoted as 
saying.

Ma Xinchun, a representative for the Urumqi city government, confirmed that 
five people were handed death sentences (with a two-year suspension). Eight 
defendants were given life in prison, whilst four more were handed sentences of 
10 years or longer.

There is no information about who these people are but, according to Radio 
Free Asia, their names appear to be Uyghur.

Hou did not elaborate on the charges that led to the convictions and 
sentencing, but they all appear related to the July 2009 unrest. He did say 
that they were published by Xinjiang newspapers; however, since July internet 
has been blocked in the province and local newspaper websites cannot be 
accessed from outside.

Protests broke in the capital Urumqi on 5 July as a result of rising 
interethnic frustrations between indigenous Uyghurs and Han Chinese settlers. 
The latter have become a majority in Xinjiang and monopolise key political and 
economic positions thanks to an immigration policy pursued by the central 
government that provides them with a number of incentives, economic or 
otherwise, in order to move to the province.

Protests started out peacefully (pictured, the 5 July demonstration) but 
turned into interethnic clashes that pitted Muslim Uyghurs against Han Chinese. 
This was followed by two days of retaliatory attacks by ethnic Chinese. The 
official death toll stands at about 200 dead and thousands of wounded.

With the latest sentences, the number of death penalties handed down in 
connection with the riots has risen to 22, of which at least nine have already 
been carried out.

In the meantime, official sources announced more trials against people accused 
of masterminding the protests.

Similarly, Cambodia announced last week that it was going to send 20 Uyghurs 
back to China. They had fled Xinjiang after the protests and applied for 
refugee status at the UN representative’s office in Phnom Penh.

This decision meets Beijing’s demands but has been severely criticised by the 
United States.

Last week, Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping signed a number of agreements 
worth US$ 1.2 billion during a visit to Cambodia. They include money for road 
building and the restoration of Buddhist temples.
