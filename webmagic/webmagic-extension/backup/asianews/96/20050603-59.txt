Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) - Amnesty International Friday called on the 
Chinese government to "release all people imprisoned during the 1989 Tiananmen 
democracy protests" and "arrest those responsible for the June 4 massacre".

"Tiananmen clearly remains very much alive today for the Chinese public and 
the demands by Chinese citizens for justice continue," the international rights 
group said in a statement.

"We reiterate said also - our call on the Chinese government to conduct an 
independent inquiry into the killing of unarmed students and demonstrators. 
Those found responsible should be tried and brought to justice. We also call on 
the government to release all those who are still imprisoned in connection with 
the Tiananmen crackdown and who never received fair trials."

China's communist-led government has taken the position that foreign concerns 
regarding the crackdown are "outdated", while maintaining that without it China 
would not have been able to enjoy 16 years of robust economic growth. Officials 
repeated that position on Thursday.

During 6 weeks troops of the national army backed by tanks, massacred 
defenceless protesters. The demonstrators had been calling for democracy and an 
end to corruption for Chinese society in the streets of the Chinese capital. 
The death toll of the massacre was never released by the government, but 
independent international organisations say thousands of people were killed 
around the square, in side streets and in the days following 4 June.

"The on-going passion that surrounds the issue in China is clear from the 
continuous string of detentions of citizens who seek to post information on the 
internet regarding the dead or missing from 1989," Amnesty said.
The group listed several Chinese recently jailed for voicing opposition to the 
government's handling of the protests and also cited the continued harassment 
of a group of relatives of June 4 victims, known as the Tiananmen Mothers, 
group composed of 125 families of victims of the disaster in Tiannamen Square 
on 4 June 1989. The group is led by Ding Zilin.
