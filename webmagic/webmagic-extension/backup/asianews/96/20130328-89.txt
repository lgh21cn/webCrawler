Beijing (AsiaNews) - China's relentless crackdown on ethnic minorities 
continues unabated. Despite its ongoing slaughter in Tibet, Beijing has opted 
for the iron fist in Xinjiang, the homeland of ethnic Uighurs in northwestern 
China. Courts handed down heavy sentences, including life in prison, against 20 
ethnic Uighurs "poisoned by religious extremism".

Judges in Kashgar and Bayingol ruled that the offenders had their "thoughts 
poisoned by religious extremism", and that they were getting ready for a holy 
war, a Xinjiang government press release said.

Uighurs are a Turkic Muslim group. From the end of World War II until the 
1990s, they sought independence from China. Today, they want religious and 
cultural autonomy.

According to exiled Uighurs, centred mostly in Germany under the leadership of 
Rebiya Kadeer, the Chinese government has magnified the threat of religious 
extremism to justify its repression against the minority.

For Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the exiled World Uyghur Congress, those 
convicted were guilty of no more than listening to the US-fundedRadio Free Asia 
and using the Internet to discuss the importance of religious and cultural 
freedom.

Xinjiang is rich in raw materials and is located in a strategic position on 
the border with South Asia and Central Asia.
