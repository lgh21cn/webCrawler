Urumqi (AsiaNews) - The Intermediate People's Court of Urumqi in Xinjiang 
found Uyghur intellectual Ilham Tohti guilty of "separatism" and sentenced him 
to life in prison.

An economics professor at Beijing-based Minzu University, Tohti has strongly 
denied charges of separatism saying in a closing statement that "he loved his 
country . . . and that it was always his opinion that it was in the best 
interests of Uighurs to remain in China".

Liu Xiaoyuan, one of his defence lawyers, announced that his client would 
appeal against the ruling.

Tohti was arrested last January 

 after he criticised Beijing's policy followingan attack in Tiananmen Square 

 in October 2013, blamed on some Uyghurs.

The government's response to the attack was to boost repression in the 
Xinjiang region.

For years, Tohti has called on the government to engage in a real dialogue 
with the Uyghurs and understand their difficulties. For this reason, in 2005 he 
launchedUyghur Online, a website to improve understanding between Uyghurs and 
ethnic Han Chinese. However, according to his accusers, the website itself was 
evidence of the academic's "separatism".

Among activists for human rights in China, his trial has sparked outrage.

"Tohti has consistently, courageously and unambiguously advocated peacefully 
for greater understanding and dialogue between various communities, and with 
the state," said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. "If 
this is Beijing's definition of 'separatist' activities, it's hard to see 
tensions in Xinjiang and between the communities decreasing."

Tohti's views are summarised in an article by his friend Tibetan writer 
Tsering Woeser 

, published in February shortly after his arrest.

"Ilham was only exercising his right to free expression, for which he should 
not be imprisoned," said Renee Xia, international director Chinese Human Rights 
Defender. "The government is trying to lay blame on him for recent violent 
incidents and divert attention from its own policy failures that have 
contributed to rising ethnic tensions."
