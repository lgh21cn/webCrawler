Urumqi (AsiaNews / Agencies) - The death toll from a spate of bombings 
September 21 has jumped to 50 people.  Theseries of explosions 

 targeted police stations and public buildings in the Bugur county (Xinjiang). 
The hike in the number of dead was reported by the state news portal,Tianshan, 
which, has given no reason for the delay in reporting the news.

The explosions occurred at around 17 (local time) in front of two police 
stations, an outdoor market and a shop. Of the 50 victims, 40 were "terrorists" 
killed in the explosions; six civilians; two police officers and two security 
agents. Two other alleged attackers were caught by the police. The number of 
wounded has been reduced from 100, as reported yesterday, to 54, all of whom 
are civilians.

 According to the Tianshan report, the main suspect is a man named Mamat 
Tursun, who has been "operating as an extremist since 2003."

 The Chinese authorities have imposed a curfew in the areas affected by the 
violence, ordering the closure of schools and offices. According to Beijing, 
the attackers are separatists from the Uyghur minority.  The Turkic and Muslim 
ethnic group from Xinjiang has been calling for greater autonomy or 
independence from China.

 Meanwhile, on September 23 a court in Urumqi sentenced Uyghur intellectual 
Ilham Tohti 

 to life imprisonment for "separatism": a ruling that has sparked outrage from 
human rights activists in China.
