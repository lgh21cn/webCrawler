Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) - Six dead and three arrested: the tally is from 
an operation carried out by Chinese police in the western province of Xinjiang, 
a majority Muslim area inhabited by ethnic Uyghurs, which for some time has 
seen episodes of violence between separatists and the central government.

 According to the initial version of events, late yesterday evening in Kasghar 
a police patrol came across nine suspects. The group is believed to have 
reacted to the command to halt from the agents by pulling out knives; the 
officers opened fire, killing six people and wounding three.

 Sources from the World Uygur Congress, an association that defends the rights 
of the Muslim minority, based in Germany, affirms that the police deliberately 
fired on the group after they decided to surrender.

 It is not the first time that the province, once known as eastern Turkestan, 
has seen episodes of violence between pro-autonomy Islamic groups and the 
Chinese army, conducting a genuine colonization of the region. Beijing accuses 
the Uyghurs of promoting terrorist attacks, and decided to conduct yet another 
security crackdown in view of the Olympics.
