Beijing (AsiaNews) - The Chinese government is confiscating all passports of 
the population of Xinjiang motivating the gesture as a fight against terrorism.

Citizens have been ordered to hand in their passports to the authorities has 
been published already for several weeks under the threat of being permanently 
banned from travel. Some Shihezi police directives, which later disappeared 
from their website, stated Â that the withdrawal of travel documents was to 
happen by next February.

 The World Uighur Congress has denounced the move as a further step towards 
the marginalization of the Uighur population. According to sources, last June, 
the Chinese authorities have forced the Uighur to give samples of their DNA in 
applying for new passports.

 The Uighur, a Muslim ethnicity of Turkic origins constitute 45% of the 
population of Xinjiang in northwest China. There have been decades of marked 
tensions between Uighur and ethnic Han (Chinese). Some Uighur fringes dream of 
independence for East Turkestan region, although the majority of them just want 
more autonomy. China responds with a colonial military rule, by marginalizing 
the Uighur from key posts in politics and economics of the region.

 China fears that the Xinjiang Muslims can strengthen alliances with the 
Taliban in Afghanistan or Pakistan, which supports the fight for independence.

 Under the motivation "anti-terrorism", though China oppresses all the Muslim 
population by banning young people from participating in the prayer in the 
mosque, forcing them to not observe the fast of Ramadan, and banning beards.

 In China, no resident has the right to have a passport, but must apply to the 
authorities. This allows authorities to control citizens foreign travels.
