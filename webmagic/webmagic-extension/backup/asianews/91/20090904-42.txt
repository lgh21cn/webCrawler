Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) – An unreal sense of calm can be felt in Urumqi, 
the capital of Xinjiang, as police in anti-riot gear patrol almost deserted 
streets. For the past two days, majority Han Chinese demonstrated in the city’s 
streets, calling for harsh punishment for Uyghurs. A conflict between the two 
ethnic groups is now a real possibility. 
Yesterday tens of thousands of Han Chinese brought the city to a halt in a 
peaceful demonstration (pictured). They accused provincial government of being 
“useless”, some even asking for the dismissal of regional Communist Party boss 
Wang Lequan, who is thought to be an ally of President Hu Jintao.

Waving banners carrying phrases such as ‘Severely punish criminals’ and ‘We 
want stability’, and shouting slogans, the Han Chinese protesters accuse the 
authorities of doing little to protect them.

Today the authorities responded by asking residents to stay at home. The net 
result is that the streets of the city are almost deserted. Tension remains 
palpable however.

In July indigenous Uyghurs and police violently clashed. At least 197 people 
were killed (including many Han Chinese) and about 1,600 were injured, this 
according to official figures. Unofficial sources claim that most of the dead 
were Uyghurs. What is certain is that police arrested thousands of Uyghurs.

Attacks on the public by unknown assailants wielding syringes triggered the 
most recent protest. Reports by local TV said that 476 people were attacked 
with hypodermic needles. Of these, 433 were Han Chinese, 19 Uyghurs and the 
remainder from other ethnic groups. But many believe the number to be at least 
twice as high.

The authorities have denied that anyone injured was infected. State-owned 
Xinhua news agency reported that 21 people were arrested in connection with the 
attacks, but did not specify their ethnic group.

Members of both ethnic groups now fear for their safety, concerned about 
walking down the street, opening their store or sending their kids to school.

In Xinjiang’s capital indigenous Uyghurs have become a minority following an 
influx of Han settlers, drawn to the province by Beijing’s job offers and 
business incentives.

For some time now the Uyghurs have complained that they are being marginalised 
in their own land as a result of policies designed to wipe out their culture 
and exclude them from all positions of political and economic power.
