Urumqi (AsiaNews) - Police in China's far western region of Xinjiang have 
raided a Qur'anic school that taught the basics of Islam to 54 children. During 
the intervention, 12 children received burns that police blame on suspects who 
"ignited a flammable device to resist capture".

"Acting on tips from local residents, police ... raided an illegal religious 
preaching venue in the city, where 54 children were being held,"Xinhua news 
agency reported. "Three suspects were seized during the operation, and three 
police officers were wounded".

According to the World Uygur Congress (WUC), a German-based group defending 
the rights of the predominantly Muslim Uygur group, which is the largest ethnic 
group in Xinjiang, police used tear gas to attack the Islamic school.

"There was a fight, and the authorities used tear gas on the young students, 
causing injuries on both sides," a WUC spokesman said. "The aim was to 
eradicate religious belief," he added.

Police arrested 47 people, including 11 women.

The province remains a hotspot of opposition against China's Communist 
government.

After a brief period of independence, the country was invaded by the People's 
Liberation Army. Since then, Uygur leaders have called on the central 
government to grant their people cultural autonomy and religious freedom.

Beijing claims that Muslim extremist groups are active in the area trying to 
destabilise the situation.
