New York (AsiaNews/HRW)  Chinese authorities are engaged in a violent 
campaign of religious and political repression against ethnic Muslim Uighurs in 
Xinjiang province, this according to a 114-page report released today by Human 
Rights Watch.

The document entitled Devastating Blows: Religious Repression of Uighurs in 
Xinjiang relies on previously undisclosed Communist Party and government 
documents, as well as local regulations, official newspaper accounts, and 
interviews conducted in the province.

It unveils for the first time the complex system of laws, regulations, and 
policies enforced in Xinjiang that deny Uighurs religious freedom, and by 
extension freedom of association, assembly, and expression.

It shows how state authorities politically examine all imams on a regular 
basis requiring them to undergo 'self-criticism' sessions; impose surveillance 
on mosques; purge schools of religious teachers and students; screen literature 
and poetry for political allusions; ban religious holidays, studying religious 
texts, or showing one's religion through personal appearance.

The authorities also vet who can be a cleric, where religious gatherings may 
be held, and what may be said.

Openly expressing one's religious identity in public places, government 
buildings and school is also strictly forbidden.

One official document goes so far as to say that "parents and legal guardians 
may not allow minors to participate in religious activities."
Human Rights Watch condemns how the government equates religious freedom and 
any expression of dissatisfaction with Beijing's policies with 'separatism'.

People practicing their religion in ways that the Party and government deem 
unacceptable are arrested, tortured, and at times executed.

The harshest punishments are reserved for those accused of so-called 
separatist activity, which officials increasingly term 'terrorism'.
What is more, half the detainees in re-education camps were arrested and 
detained without due process and "the worldwide campaign against terrorism has 
given Beijing the perfect excuse to crack down harder than ever in Xinjiang," 
said Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch. "Other Chinese enjoy a 
growing freedom to worship, but the Uighurs, like the Tibetans, find that their 
religion is being used as a tool of control."

As Xinjiang Party Secretary Wang Lequan himself has stressed, the "major task" 
facing the authorities in Xinjiang is to "manage religion and guide it in being 
subordinate to the central task of economic construction, the unification of 
the motherland, and the objective of national unity."
The Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority of some eight million people, whose 
traditional homeland lies in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in northwest 
China, have become increasingly fearful for their cultural survival and 
traditional way of life in the face of an intensive internal migration drive 
that saw more than 1.2 million ethnic Chinese settlers arrive over the past 
decade and whose presence is radically changing local social structures.

Most Uighurs desire greater autonomy than is currently allowed; however, in 
more recent years, a small but growing minority is demanding independence from 
China.
