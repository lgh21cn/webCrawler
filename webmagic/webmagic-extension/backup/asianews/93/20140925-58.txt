Urumqi (AsiaNews / RFA) - At least 12 people are dead and over 100 wounded 
following a series of bomb attacks against government buildings and police 
stations in Bugur county (Xinjiang region). The attacks date to September 21, 
but details only emerged today. The police suspect that the bombs were the work 
of separatists from the Uyghur minority, who have long complained of being 
subjected to ethnic discrimination, oppressive religious controls, and social 
boycott.

 Victims include three policemen and the seven attackers. All of these died in 
the attack on a police station in Yengisar. The other cities affected are Bugue 
and Terekbazar, but the official number of the victims is not yet known.

 Bugur County Hospital has admitted the people with serious injuries. "There 
are at least 100 - says a nurse - because the beds are full". Patients being 
treated include 20 policemen and a man suspected of being part of the group of 
attackers.

 The Xinjiang region is one of the most turbulent in all of China. Its Uyghur 
Muslim minority, who number about nine million, have long sought independence 
from China. The central government, for its part, has brought in hundreds of 
thousands of settlers to make Han Chinese the dominant ethnic group. At the 
same time, it has severely curtailed Muslim religious worship as well as the 
teaching of the local language and culture.
