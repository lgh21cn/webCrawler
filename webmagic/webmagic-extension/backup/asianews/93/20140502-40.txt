Urumqi ( AsiaNews) - Yesterday's bomb attack on the train station in Urumqi 
, capital of the northern province 
of Xinjiang, "is the work of religious extremists, who have long been under a 
subversive and separatist influence". This is according to provincial 
authorities, quoted by the official Xinhua news . In the attack both the 
terrorists and an innocent civilian were killed: 79 people were injured, some 
are in critical condition. One of the two assailants was identified: Sedirdin 
Sawut, a Chinese citizen aged 39, from Aksu county.

The attack took place shortly after President Xi Jinping's departure from the 
region: the Chinese leader spent 4 days in Xinjiang, his first official visit 
to the area, during whichhe urged people to "better understand the separatism" 

 of some local fringe groups to be able to "fight it better". According to 
several analysts and experts, the fact that the attack took place to coincide 
with Xi's visit of demonstrates that the extremists "want to raise the bar " in 
the armed confrontation with the authorities.

The central authorities have not clarified how they are going to investigate 
the case. Some groups of Uyghurs living abroad say that at least 100 people 
have already been arrested, but without giving precise data. Certainly security 
in the area has been significantly stepped up, and the normal police forces 
stationed in the region have be joined by at least 2 battalions from the 
People's Liberation Army.

Xinjiang province is one of the most turbulent in all of China. It is the 
homeland of ethnic Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim people that has 
always sought independence from Beijing. The central government has sent 
hundreds of thousands of Han Chinese to the region to try to make them the 
dominant ethnic group. It has also imposed serious restrictions on freedom of 
religion, Muslim practices, the teaching of the indigenous language and the 
local culture.

Since 2009 Chinese police and the military have held the region under a 
special regime, which Beijing imposed followingclashes that left nearly 200 
people dead 

. As a result of various episodes of violence, hundreds of long prison 
sentences were imposed and dozens of death penalties were carried out. Chinese 
authorities blame Muslim extremists for the wave of violence. Uyghur exiles 
claim instead that Beijing is "exaggerating" the threat of Islamic terrorism to 
justify repression against indigenous Uyghurs.

For Beijing, Uyghurs are responsible for the recent spate of violent attacks, 
including the 1 March 2014attack at the Kunming railway station 

 by knives-wielding men that left 29 people dead and more than 150 wounded, and 
the 28 October 2013 incident whenan SUV plunged into a crowd in Tiananmen Square
 

, then burst into flames, killing three people. The government believe that the 
ethnic group is behind these attacks.
