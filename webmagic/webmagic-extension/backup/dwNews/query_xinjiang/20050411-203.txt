DaimlerChrysler-owned Mercedes-Benz Trucks is preparing to team up with its Chinese partners to produce a wider range of vans and trucks on the mainland, state media reported Monday. The US-German auto giant is looking to locally produce its Mercedes-Benz branded vans and trucks, including the Actros, Axor, Atego and Unimog series, the  said, citing DaimlerChrysler (China) Ltd general manager Rainer Schaefer. The auto firm commanded 32 percent of China's heavy-duty truck market last year and aims to increase its share to 40 percent within a few years, the newspaper said. "Through years of preparation, from product introduction to dealership networks, from technology updates to after-sales services improvement, our solid business foundation in China has been established," Schaefer said. Mercedes-Benz Trucks has gradually expanded its business from western and coastal areas to regions in central China and along the transportation artery of northeast China. It recently won a bid for Xinjiang Guanghui's liquefied natural gas transportation program, the newspaper added.
