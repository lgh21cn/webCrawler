 The ethnic Uighur defendants of Chinese nationality were driven straight into 
the military court building Tuesday, preventing reporters from approaching them.

Mieraili Yusufu and Bilal Mohammad 

 are accused of being behind the August 17, 2015 bombing of the Erawan shrine 
that killed 20 people - 14 of them tourists.

 Prosecutors accuse Mohammed of placing the bomb inside a backpack at the 
shrine and say Mieraili was involved in transporting the device.

 Both have pleaded not guilty at a recent pre-trial hearing where they broke 
down in tears and complained of mistreatment at the hands of authorities which 
he said threatened him with deportation and menaced him with a police dog.

 Defense attorneys say they don't expect proceedings to be swift.

 "Today is the first day for witness testimony ... I think it (the trial) will 
last until next year. It will take quite some time," Chuchart Kanpai, a defense 
attorney said.

 Prosecutors allege the bombing was revenge by a people-smuggling gang whose 
activities were disrupted by a crackdown.

 But others speculate the violence could be the work of Uighur separatists 
angry that Thailand in July hadforcibly repatriated scores of their brethren to 
China, where they could face persecuted 

.

 Thai national Kanya Mayoon, 36, lost her sister Prani Srisuwa in the bombing 
and says he's not convinced authorities are interested in getting real answers.

 "It seemed like they just wanted to close the case quickly," she told the AFP 
news agency. "I just want the real masterminds to be arrested and punished."

 The shrine is popular among ethnic Chinese tourists, who made up a majority 
of the dead with five from Malaysia, five from China and two from Hong Kong.

 Thailand's military courts were strengthened to try civilians in "national 
security" cases after aMay 2014 military coup 

. The defendants have been held at an army base since their arrest in late 
August and early September 2015.

 No other details of their interrogation have been revealed.

 Some of the 15 other suspects 
 are 
Turks, with whom Uighurs share ethnic bonds, and Turkey is home to a large 
Uighur community.
  
The August 17, 2015 bombing of the Erawan shrine in Bangkok's most popular 
shopping district of Ratchaprasong was one of the deadliest acts of violence in 
Thailand in decades.

One of the deadliest attacks in decades

 The Uighur minority claims cultural and religious repression in their 
homeland of Xinjiang in northwest China, and many have fled the restive region 
in recent years.

 Thai police's conduct raised questions when the office's then-chief - who has 
since gone on to become head of Thailand's soccer federation - awarded his 
officers an $80,000 reward that had been open to the public.
