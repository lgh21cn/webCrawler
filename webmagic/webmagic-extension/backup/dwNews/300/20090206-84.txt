Munich Willing To Accept Guantanamo Uighurs
<\TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
Munich's municipal council is backing a motion submitted by the Green party to host 17 members of the Chinese minority held at Guantanamo Bay. The controversial offer still has to be approved by the Chancellor.

The Bavarian city has the largest population of ethnic Uighurs outside of 
China and the motion now must gain approval from German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel's cross-party government before it can accept the inmates.

US President Barack Obama is closing the prison that was established on Cuba 
to house terror suspects. But several European countries have expressed a 
disinterest in accepting prisoners, claiming they are the US government's 
responsibility.

Gaining approval to accept the Uighur inmates in Munich will not be easy 
because the German government is divided on the issue of hosting Guantanamo 
inmates. Social Democrat Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier is in favor 
of taking in some freed prisoners while Christian Democrat Interior Minister 
Wolfgang Schaueble is against it.

The Uighurs at Guantanamo were arrested after the US invaded Afghanistan and 
have been imprisoned there for seven years. Washington has cleared them of any 
terrorist activity, but hasn't repatriated them to China for fear they would be 
persecuted or tortured upon their return.

China outraged

This has angered China, which says the group of 17 are part of a United 
Nations-listed terror group seeking an independent homeland in the Xinjiang 
region. The latter lies in the northwest of China and is home to the largest 
Uighur population. Uighurs are mostly Muslim.

Beijing has demanded that the Uighurs be returned and it issued a warning on 
Thursday after learning that three of the prisoners have applied for refugee 
status in Canada.

Most Uighurs are Muslim and reside in northwest China

"We have expressed our position many times about those Chinese terrorists 
detained in Guantanamo. We are opposed to any country accepting those people," 
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told reporters in Beijing. "We 
hope the parties concerned can resolve conveniently this issue according to the 
international laws and regulations."
