<\TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
State media in China's restive Xinjiang region say blasts have killed at least two people but have given few details. In the past year scores have died in tensions between mainly-Muslim Uighurs and security forces.

 The communist-run Tianshan news portal said explosions happened at three 
places, including a shop, in Luntai county. It lies in a desert area 360 
kilometers (220 miles) southwest of the western region's capital of Urumqi.

 "Public security officers quickly handled the situation," the portal said, 
adding that an unspecified number of injured had been taken to hospital.

 "Local social order is normal, and the cases are being investigated," 
Tianshan said.

Officials punished for 'failures'

 On Sunday, state media said the Communist Party officials in Xinjiang had 
demoted or dismissed 17 officials and police officers for alleged failures 
relating to two incidents in July.

 Tight security makes it difficult for foreign journalists to visit the region.

 Exiled Uighur groups say the government's repressive policies 

 in Xinjiang, including curbs on Islam, have provoked unrest, a claim denied by 
Beijing.

Violent incidents

 On July 28, the government said 37 civilians were killed and 59 alleged 
"terrorists" were shot dead by security forces in two towns in Xinjiang's far 
south.

 On June 30, three assailants armed with knives and axes killed Juma Tayir, 
the imam of Xinjiang's biggest mosque in the old Silk Road city of Kashgar.
