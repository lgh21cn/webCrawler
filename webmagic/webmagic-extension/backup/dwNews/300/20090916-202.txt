Cologne Cinema Shows "Visions of China"
<\TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
After Bollywood and Hollywood, China is the third biggest movie producer in the world. Despite problems with copyright infringement, it is also fast emerging as one of the biggest markets for the industry. World famous directors such as Zhang Yimou have contributed greatly to the revival of Chinese film with successes at major international festivals. At this year's Chinese Film Festival in Cologne, it was the turn of other talented Chinese filmmakers to try to make a name for themselves.

The Chinese movie industry is growing steadily. More than 500 films are 
produced each year – mainly in Shanghai and Beijing.

Cologne’s Filmhaus chose the title “Visions of China” for its third Chinese 
film festival. The annual festival offers young Chinese directors to show their 
work to a wide audience.

17 full-length films as well as several short films are being shown this year. 
The organisers have focused on works that deal with ethnic minorities with, for 
example, films about Inner Mongolia and the Muslim area of Xinjiang.

“We did not get a general overview of Chinese cinema but only saw a small 
selection of the films that are produced there,” said Dirk Werner, one of the 
festival’s curators. “Then, we made a further selection and we decided to show 
films from different parts of China. We also decided to show films from remote 
provinces.”

Rapid developments over the past few years

Chinese cinema has developed rapidly in the past few years and more and more 
films have found their way to international film festivals, where they are 
proving to be very popular and receiving good reviews. They also have a huge 
amount of fans.

Zheng Yi, a 28-year-old director in Cologne to show his films, does not think 
the new developments are only positive: “I think that in recent years Chinese 
movies have become more and more commercial. There is no filmmaking without 
money. It is not like drawing, where all you need is a pencil and some paper. 
The movie business has changed as China has developed economically. Many see 
movies as an investment.”

Zheng Yi did acknowledge, however, that the developments also mean that more 
directors can make films as there are more and more film studios and production 
companies.

No commercial films in Cologne

There are no commercial films to be seen at Cologne’s festival. Instead, it 
offers viewers the chance to see films that have been censored by the Chinese 
authorities and banned in China.

“We are not toeing the party line and only showing what China has approved,” 
insists Werner. “We didn’t do it last time either. We want other voices also to 
have a chance to be heard.”
