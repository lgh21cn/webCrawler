Chicago (AsiaNews/Agencies)  Rebyia Kadeer, a woman released yesterday by 
Chinese authorities, arrived in Chicago over night. Speaking to Radio Free Asia 
Ms Kadeer said: "I can smile at my people. I can work for my people, and I can 
work for the entire Uighur nation". To the Radio's Uighur-service, she said to 
"say goodbye to my people and my homeland for me."

John Kamm, president of the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation and an 
activist who helped arrange her release, said he and his official contacts had 
been 'working intensely' for three weeks on Ms Kadeer's release.

He also said: "I've been led to believe ... that the Chinese are doing this as 
a gesture for Condi Rice. I was told they wanted to do this before she arrived."

Rebiya Kadeer, 58, is one of the best known activists for women's and Uighur 
rights. Uighurs  are predominantly Muslim and live in Xinjiang, China's 
western-most province, where a separatist movement has been demanding 
independence for some time.

Until 1999 Ms Kadeer was a successful businesswoman. She was then jailed on 
national security charges for sending Chinese newspapers to her husband in the 
US. She was first sentenced to eight years in prison, reduced to seven for good 
behaviour.

Her detention, which many human rights groups consider illegal, was taken up 
by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is to visit China in the next 
few days.

"We welcome the announcement of her release," White House spokesman Scott 
McClellan said.
