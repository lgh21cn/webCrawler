Urumqi (AsiaNews / Agencies) - China's central government has ordered the 
authorities of Xinjiang "to secure" the province afterthe violence on July 28 

, which resulted in dozens of deaths and injuries. The streets of Kashgar and 
Yarkand County, say local sources, are "full of soldiers, policemen and armed 
checkpoints".

The internet has been cut off and the phones are tapped to prevent contact 
with the outside. At the same time, the government formally charged Ilham 
Tohti, a Uyghur academic who campaigns for respect for minority rights in China.

 The Xinjiang region is one of the most turbulent in all of China. Its Uyghur 
Muslim minority, who number about nine million, have long sought independence 
from China. The central government, for its part, has brought in hundreds of 
thousands of settlers to make Han Chinese the dominant ethnic group. At the 
same time, it has severely curtailed Muslim religious worship as well as the 
teaching of the local language and culture.

The dynamics of the attack against the government structures that took place 
on Monday and were termed "terrorist" by the authorities are still unclear: 
mainstream media reported the violence days later and local officials refuse to 
answer the questions of the few foreign journalists in the area.

What is certain is that both Chinese Han and Uyghurs died in the clashes. 
According to some sources quoted by newspapers close to the Communist Party, it 
all started after the discovery of a "large quantity of explosives" in the 
house of a separatist Uyghur. Members of the minority deny this and talk of 
clashes provoked by Chinese repression during the month of Ramadan.


 Despite the high tension, the central government has, however, decided to 
announce formal charges against Ilham Tothi, an ethnic Uyghur economics 
professor and famous activist for the rights of minorities living in China. The 
academichas been in jail 

since last January: Beijing accuse him of "separatism" a crime that carries the 
death penalty, and added that his trial will begin "very soon".
