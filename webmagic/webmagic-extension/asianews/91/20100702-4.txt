Beijing (AsiaNews / Agencies) - The world "shows more attention to the Uyghur 
cause in China, but could do much more for us”, says Rebiya Kadeer, the Uyghur 
leader exiled in the United States to commemorate the first anniversary of one 
of the bloodiest ethnic riots to take place in the Asian country. Meanwhile, to 
control the situation, the central government has installed 40 thousand cameras 
in the provincial capital Urumqi.

A year ago, in fact, an ethnic Uyghur Muslim community residing in the 
northern province of Xinjiang challenged the domination of central government 
in Beijing.  During the clashes, according to official sources, 200 people were 
killed. A further 1,700 were wounded, while the number of arrests is unknown: 
according to dissident leader, there are tens of thousands detained.

The Uyghur are not asking for independence from Beijing, but demand greater 
autonomy. Although Xinjiang - the dissidents call the region East Turkistan - 
is one of the provinces with special status created by Mao Zedong, residents 
accuse the authorities of banning education in the local language and customs, 
in favour of the dominant Chinese Han ethnicity. The latter, supported by 
authorities, also enact a kind of "economic racism" which tends to keep the 
natives of the region far from the centres of power.

Rebiya Kadeer, a 63 year old mother of 11 children, spent many years in prison 
because of her opposition to the Chinese regime but - before the confrontation 
- tried to use the "institutional" channels to advance the cause of her people. 
She was a deputy at the National People’s Assembly in Beijing and was a 
successful business woman. Today, in exile in the U.S., she says: "I'm just an 
ordinary woman, but I fear the government.This shows that my demands are just. "

China “accuses the Uyghur of being Islamic extremists, but has no evidence to 
support these false accusations. What it does have is an enormous economic 
power, which allows it to silence the protests of Western governments and the 
Muslims". Beijing announced it would invest about 10 billion Yuan (1 billion) 
in the region by 2011, to "improve the Uyghur’s living conditions".

According to Kadeer, this announcement “is part of Chinese trade policy. If 
they really want to change things, they must release the innocent people they 
have detained and apologized for what they have done not only to the Uyghur, 
but all the people of East Turkestan". In any case, it seems that Beijing's 
attitude is not destined to change.

On the anniversary of the massacre, which falls on 5 July, the police have 
locked down the capital. Forty thousand cameras have been installed on public 
buses, stations, along 4 thousand streets, 270 schools and 100 supermarkets. 
According to authorities, the electronic eyes are "to ensure safety in most 
important public places and allow all people of all ethnic groups, to enjoy 
government services".

Against Chinese repression, the World Uyghur Congress (Association which 
gathers dissidents’ from the ethnic group from around the world) has organized 
an international event for the anniversary. Protest marches are planned in 
front of Chinese embassies in the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain and 
Turkey.
