Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) – The authorities are saying nothing about an 
attempt by three people, two men and a woman, to set themselves on fire inside 
a car at the intersection of Chang’an Avenue and shopping street Wangfujing, in 
downtown Beijing, about a kilometre from Tiananmen Square. 
The man, 59, and the woman, 58, were brought to Jishuitan Hospital in serious 
conditions.

Nothing is known about the second man, but eyewitnesses said he was young. It 
is believed he might be in police custody.

They set themselves on fire when police stopped them for a check because their 
car had a non-Beijing license platewith three red flags on the roof.

Police pulled all three out before the car exploded.

In reporting the event state news agency Xinhua only said that the three 
people came to Beijing to submit “personal petitions”.

It might be significant that the authorities did not release any names, a 
detail that might suggest a possible motive. Eyewitnesses said in fact that the 
car had a Xinjiang licence plate and that the three people inside looked ethnic 
“Uyghur”.

Extreme public protests are not rare in China given the country’s systematic 
lack of rights.

Self-immolation in public is seen by many as the ultimate refusal of someone 
else’s unjust action and violence; it is a way to highlight their reprehensible 
behaviour.

In recent years at least ten people have set themselves on fire in Tiananmen 
Square, in the heart of Beijing, a place rich in history.

On 20 July 2006 Wang Congan, a migrant worker from Jiangsu, soaked himself in 
gasoline and turned himself into a human torch in front of hundreds of 
tourists. Wang, who survived, had not been paid for months by a construction 
firm in Yuanan County (Hubei). He had come to Beijing seeking redress, without 
getting it.

Before that an elderly couple unjustly thrown out of their home also set 
themselves on fire; so did workers who were cheated out of their wages; or 
people just too tired of submitting petitions that got nowhere.

The latest incident could also be connected to important upcoming events and 
anniversaries like the annual National People’s Congress, the 50th anniversary 
of the crushing of the Tibet uprising, the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen 
Square massacre, the 10th anniversary of the banning of the Falun Gong 
spiritual movement, and the 60th anniversary of China’s occupation of Xinjiang.

But Beijing is not the only place where such incidents are taking place. 
Yesterday in Shenzhen a migrant worker, Fang Donglei, set himself on fire after 
he was sacked by his employer, Welluxe Technology and Manufacturing, without 
motivation or severance pay.

Mr Fang's wife, Li Xinxia, told the South China Morning Post that after 
another argument with the firm’s supervisor he set himself on fire in front of 
him. Now he is in hospital with burns covering 55 per cent of his body.

If survives he has to pick up the medical bill because the “factory paid just 
8,000 yuan for the hospital deposit and we're still waiting for enough money 
for skin-graft surgery,” Ms Li said.

Human rights group Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) recently reported 
that the life of Wang Guilan, sentenced to 15 months of re-education through 
labour in August 2008, is in danger because prison authorities have denied her 
much needed medical treatment.

In 2001 Ms Wang Guilan was forced out of her business in an Enshi City mall by 
developers and never properly compensated.

Unable to seek redress through legal avenues and abused by court officials 
when she went in search of justice, she set herself on fire in protest and 
suffered traumatic injuries.

Having survived this ordeal she became an activist for petitioners’ rights, 
organising a public letter to public officials on behalf of petitioners and 
exposing illegal police practices directed against petitioners in Beijing. 

For her troubles she was arrested last year on charges of “disturbing the 
social order” and later sentenced to 15 months in a forced labour camp because 
she had accepted a phone interview with a foreign journalist.

Now she needs immediate medical attention because she suffers from 
hypertension and heart disease and her burn wounds are badly infected.
