Beijing (AsiaNews) - Authorities in the western province of Xinjiang have 
sentenced 22 Islamic preachers in recent days to sentences ranging from five to 
16 years in prison. Charges against them include separatism, ethnic hatred and 
disturbing the peace.

The verdict was read in public at the People's Court of Kashgar. The area is 
known for its violent attacks in recent months, which according to Beijing that 
are orchestrated by Muslim separatists.

According to the judiciary report the preachers include "rogue imams," or 
those already removed from their mosques and religious still in office. 
Ainiwaer Tuerxun, mayor of Kashgar, said the province is "plagued by religious 
extremism" which has "fomented terrorism in the region."

According to the politician, reading the sentence in public "is a powerful 
deterrent that will help stop those who break the law through religion."

 Meng Caixia, a teacher, told the South China Morning Post that the problem of 
religious extremism "is serious, and is having a profound impact in the area. 
Some preachers are involved in this activity, and it is very difficult for them 
to be open-minded and accept what they are told".

The province is one of the most turbulent in all of China. Its Uyghur Muslim 
minority, who number about nine million, have long sought independence from 
China.

The central government, for its part, has brought in hundreds of thousands of 
settlers to make Han Chinese the dominant ethnic group.

At the same time, it has severely curtailed Muslim religious worship as well 
as the teaching of the local language and culture.

Since 2009 Chinese police and the military have held the region under a 
special regime, which Beijing imposed followingclashes that left nearly 200 
people dead 

. As a result of various episodes of violence, hundreds of long prison 
sentences were imposed and dozens of death penalties were carried out.

Chinese authorities blame Muslim extremists for the wave of violence. Uyghur 
exiles claim instead that Beijing is "exaggerating" the threat of Islamic 
terrorism to justify repression against indigenous Uyghurs.
