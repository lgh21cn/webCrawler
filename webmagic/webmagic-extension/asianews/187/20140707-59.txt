Beijing (AsiaNews / Agencies) - 17 miners have died after becoming trapped in 
a mine in north-west China at the weekend, following an explosion caused by a 
gas leak. The state Xinhua news agency reports that the incident took place on 
July 5 at 8:43 pm in a quarry situated about 120 km from Urumqi, capital of 
Xinjiang region.

According to latest reports, the 17 workers died and there is no more hope of 
finding them alive, while three other workers in the quarry at the time of the 
explosion were immediately rescued and brought to safety. The authorities have 
opened an investigation.

The latest site in a long series of coal mine incidents Dahuangshan Yuxin Coal 
Mining Co. Ltd, is owned by the Sixth Agricultural Division of Xinjiang 
Production and Construction Corps. It is a paramilitary organization, 
constituted by the central government in the 80s to contribute to the 
development of the region.

 At the moment, China has about 12 thousand mines that are operative in 
different capacities. The national subsoil is still rich in coal, but according 
to some estimates, it will not be enough to keep up with the pace of industrial 
production. In fact, China is the world's largest coal consumer and relies on 
it for 70% of its ever-growing energy needs.

According to the latest government statistics, in 2012 1,384 people were 
killed in mines. In 2011, 1,973 more died, all in accidents in coal mines, with 
a reduction of 19% over the previous year. But human rights groups and private 
Chinese scholars argue that the figure is much higher: the owners of the mines 
often don't report incidents for fear of economic losses, fines or plant 
closures.

 Very often local authorities are corrupted by bribes to turn a blind eye to 
the lack of safety standards. The closure of the mines is, according to the new 
President Xi Jinping, another campaign against the corruption of communist 
officials.
