Mosul (AsiaNews) – More and more Asian fighters speaking Chinese are seen in 
the streets of Mosul, jihadi Uighur mercenaries who came to Syria through 
Turkey at the start of the war. In the last few months, they and their families 
have moved from Rakka in Syria – the Islamic State’s capital – to Iraq.

In April 2015, many of them went from Turkey to Azerbaijan to attack targets 
in Nagorno Karabakh 

 in what came to be known as the ‘Four-day War’.

Armenian intelligence informed the West and Russia that Uyghur, Turkmen and 
Chechen fighters left Azerbaijan for Turkey.

Dubbed Daesh’s police, the Uyghurs can be seen everywhere in Mosul. Deployed 
in markets, intersections, and government buildings, their task is to police 
the capital of the Islamic Caliphate.

According to information from Mosul, Caliph al-Baghdadi also gave Uyghurs the 
important mission of securing the plains lying to the right of Mosul.

For years, Turkey has backed Turkic-speaking Muslim Uyghurs in their struggle 
to secede from China. It is also common knowledge that Ankara brought in and 
trained Uyghurs fighters before sending them to Syria.

Now the Uyghurs have "voluntarily" moved from Syria to Iraq with Daesh at a 
time when Turkey, as its only supporter, threatens to participate in the ground 
assault to free Mosul from Daesh, “which has nothing to do with Islam."

Two days ago, Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, who also said that 
Daesh has "nothing to do with Islam”, noted that "We are fighting armed men 
from dozens of countries who joined Daesh".

Scores of reports suggest however that Turkey has allowed jihadist fighters 
and weapons to enter Syria and, through the latter, Iraq.

Iraqi Popular Forces Commander Karim Al Nuri, told a Pan-Arab television 
network that “we shall liberate Mosul with Iraqi groups" and that "we cannot 
allow Mosul to become a platform for Turkish President Erdogan’s ambitions."

Nuri was referring  to statements by the Turkish president 

 announcing a few days ago that Turkey would take part in the offensive against 
the jihadists of the Islamic State (IS) in Mosul. According to Erdogan, only 
"Sunni Arabs and Kurds, and Turkmen" should remain in Mosul.

Speaking on the matter, Nuri welcome international efforts in favour of Iraq 
but stressed that “Turkey’s (military) intervention in Iraq is a violation of 
international law”.

In view of this, he called on the Turkish president to change plans, 
describing “Turkish presence in Iraq is no different to Daesh occupation”.

"We want to liberate Mosul and reiterate its Arab character. Those who think 
they can act as guardians of Turkmen” are mistaken. “Turkmen are Iraqi 
citizens, and we shall not allow them to become someone’s else pawns.” (P.B.)
