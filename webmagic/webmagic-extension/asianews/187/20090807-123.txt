Dharamsala (AsiaNews) – China's policies towards its ethnic minorities “failed 
to . . . bring trust” over the last six decades and must change, exiled Tibetan 
spiritual leader the Dalai Lama said at a press conference in Geneva. Beijing, 
he believes, must adopt a more holistic approach in its bid to win trust, 
rather than just trying to buy the support of minorities. 
“Only money will not bring [about the] good image of China and trust. Trust is 
based on transparency and honesty,” he said.

Beijing has often been accused of repressive policies towards its ethnic 
minorities (Tibetans and Uyghurs, for example), going so far as trying to 
eliminate their traditions and language.

China has always countered that it brought more opportunities and greater 
economic development to these regions.

For their parts, ethnic minorities have rejected such arguments, saying that 
economic development was meant to favour millions of Han settlers in Tibet and 
Xinjiang, to the extent that the indigenous population is being reduced to 
minority status in their own land.

Instead for the Dalai Lama “moral authority is very essential” even if China 
were to become an economic superpower.

The Tibetan leader is not out to get a quick condemnation of Chinese 
repression, but he does insist that “General harmony is very essential,” adding 
that that it “is our mutual responsibility to find a solution, without 
separation”.

For Beijing Dalai Lama remains a dangerous terrorist who wants Tibet’s 
secession from China. Tibet’s spiritual leader has instead always insisted that 
his demands are limited to greater autonomy for his homeland.

Right now the Chinese in Tibet are engaged in a systematic crackdown following 
protests in March 2008.

In the spring of that year, when many foreign leaders threatened to boycott 
the Beijing Olympics, Chinese authorities relented, accepting to open talks 
with representatives of the Dalai Lama, only to renege once the Olympic Games 
over.

Since talks with China’s leaders are near to impossible, the Dalai Lama is 
intensifying contact with Chinese intellectuals whose response has been “very 
positive”, the Dalai Lama said.

“Basically, things are changing” in China. “I have faith that Chinese 
intellectuals” and “Chinese people [will] see things more holistically, more 
realistically . . . . I am very optimistic,” he said.

Meanwhile anti-Chinese resentment continues. Last month dissatisfaction boiled 
over among Xinjiang’s Uyghurs, spilling into the streets, generating urban 
unrest that led to more than 190 dead and thousands of injured.
