Kunming ( AsiaNews / Agencies) - Last night a hundred people held a 
candlelight vigil at the train station in Kunming (Yunnan Province), where 
March 1 last a bloody attack targeted commuters and passengers. Men and women 
dressed in black and wearing masks assaulted bystanders with curved swords and 
meat cleavers, instantly killing 29 people and wounding more than 130. The 
critically injured includes a woman six months pregnant. According to the 
Chinese authorities ethnic Uyghur "separatists" are responsible for the attack. 
However, there is still no evidence against them.

The massacre took place at 21:30 on Saturday evening. The Kunming station, in 
the capital of Yunnan, is one of the largest and busiest in all of China. The 
police have described the massacre as "a well-organized terrorist attack": The 
attackers randomly stabbed those present, in the chest , neck and head. Four of 
them - three men and one woman - were killed on the spot by police. Another 
woman suspect is under arrest and is in hospital.

More than 100 people participated in a spontaneous vigil last night. A 53 year 
old man said he was find"very saddened" by what happened, but urged the 
government to provide answers to the problems in Xinjiang. "No one ever told us 
why there is so much tension there - said the man - what did our government do 
to attract so much anger?".

The Uyghur ethnic group lives in the northern autonomous region of Xinjiang, 
is of the Turkish language and the Muslim faith, and denounces a strong 
linguistic, cultural and religious repression by the Chinese central 
government. Over the years there have been numerous violent clashes between the 
two sides: Beijing argues the region is home to Islamic extremists and 
separatists, while local activists pointing the finger at ethnic tensions 
caused by the Chinese control and "racist" policies in implemented by the 
central government.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said that the government "will do everything" to 
clarify what happened and bring the perpetrators to justice. The governments of 
Russia, France, the United States and Japan have unanimously condemned the 
attack and expressed their condolences to the victims. Ban Ki- moon, Secretary 
General of the United Nations, said that " there is no justification for the 
murder of innocent civilians."

 The attack took place a few days before two important appointments for 
Chinese politics: the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC), scheduled for today, and the National People's Congress 
(NPC, China's parliament), on March 5.
