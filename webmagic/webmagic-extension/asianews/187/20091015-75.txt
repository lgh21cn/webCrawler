Beijing (AsiaNews / Agencies) - Six people today received the death sentence, 
charged with being behind the riots that broke out in Xinjiang last July. 
Earlier in the week 6 others were sentenced to death.

The People's Court of Urumqi has ruled a stay of two years in the sentence for 
three of the condemned. In the trial of the 14 defendants, three were sentenced 
to life imprisonment and five to prison for several years.

On 5 July last, peaceful demonstrations of protest by Uyghurs in Urumqi 
degenerated into ethnic clashes between the Muslim and Han Chinese populations. 
The police and army repressed tensions carrying out thousands of arrests. 
Uyghurs accuse Han of colonizing them, having occupied all the top positions in 
business and public administration. For decades, the Uyghur population has been 
suffering a heavy military control, which has grown in recent months, in the 
aftermath of the clashes.

The Uyghurs in exile have condemned the death sentences, calling them "the 
first mass of a execution promised by the Chinese government." According to 
international organizations for human rights, Beijing carries out an average of 
hundreds of executions in Xinjiang in a year.

A statement by the World Uyghur Congress confesses that they "can only hope 
that the world will stop China in its ongoing bloody repression of the Uyghur 
people."
