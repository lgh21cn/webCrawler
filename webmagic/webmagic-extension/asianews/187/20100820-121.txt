Beijing (AsiaNews / Agencies) - Authorities in the northern province of 
Xinjiang have identified two suspects in the bombing that yesterday hit Aksu, a 
Northern province. Two people, a man and a woman, were identified although the 
second seems to have died in the blast, which caused seven deaths and 14 
wounded.

Regional government spokesman Hou Hanmin, stated the male author of the 
attack, who belongs to the Muslim Uyghur minority, has been arrested. According 
to the spokesman, the man threw a three-wheeled bicycle packed with explosives 
at a group of people in a street in the suburb of Aksu, 50 meters from Duolang 
bridge.

Hou said that it is unclear if the attack is linked to ethnic tensions, but 
added that most of the victims were Uyghurs or from other minorities. Witnesses 
report that several policemen were wounded in their attempt to stop the man. 
The police also closed the area and the city centre, inspecting the bags of all 
passersby. However, Hou denies that martial law is in force.

Xinjiang is home to a minority of eight million Uyghurs out of a population of 
20 million people. Last year the region was the scene of violence between 
Uyghurs and Han Chinese which caused the deaths of at least 200 people.
