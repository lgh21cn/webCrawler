Qingshuihe (AsiaNews) – After 32 days in prison, four unofficial Christians 
from northern Xinjiang province were released on 26 November. They were 
tortured by prison guards and by convicts sharing their cells throughout their 
detention.

On the same day, the Religious Affair Bureau forcibly shut down a house church 
inAnhui that had been set up 53 years ago by the charismatic pastor Wang. 
Further, the bureau threatened around 200 Christians who used to attend the 
church with “serious repercussions” if they did not accept to be subject to the 
government-approved Movement of the Three Autonomies (MTA).

This was denounced by China Aid Association (CAA), a US-based non-governmental 
organisation that lobbies for religious freedom inChina.

The CAA said that “without giving any reasons for their arrest or release”, 
the authorities of northern Xinjiang province freed all the Christians who had 
been arrested last month in Qingshuihe in the eastern part of the province.

Four detainees were imprisoned for 32 days without charge and now they are in 
hospital.

One told how he was “tortured every day. The guards beat me if I ate the food 
or did not eat the food, ate too much or too little, went to the toilet or did 
not go to the toilet! They just beat me for no reason.”

Another, Tan, said he was put in the same cell as homosexual convicts. “The 
guards put me there on purpose.I was humiliated physically and psychologically. 
I would not come out alive if I had been with them any longer.”
