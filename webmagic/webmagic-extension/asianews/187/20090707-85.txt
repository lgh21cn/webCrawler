Uyghurs and Tibetans are experiencing the same repression, Tibetan leader says
<\TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
Police violence in Urumqi is similar to that in Lhasa in March 2008. Beijing should draw some lessons from the Xinjiang riots, namely find a solution to the Tibetan question with the Dalai Lama. Tibet’s spiritual leader has urged his countrymen and women to use non-violence, but once he is dead Tibetan frustrations could turn into an uprising.

Daramshala (AsiaNews) – “The policy of the Chinese government towards the 
Uyghurs is very similar to that towards the Tibetan people. Uyghurs and 
Tibetans suffer the same Chinese occupation; both of us are repressed and 
dominated and have to endure humiliations,” saidUrgen Tenzin, executive 
director of the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (TCHRD) as he 
spoke toAsiaNews about China’s crackdown against protests in Urumqi and other 
Xinjiang cities.

“However unlike the Uighur people, the people of Tibet have the spiritual and 
moral guidance of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who repeatedly emphasises and 
insists that all Tibetans follow the non-violent path for the resolution of the 
Tibetan issue.”

Current events in Xinjiang are very similar to what happened last year in 
Tibet. Demonstrations in Lhasa and other Tibetan regions turned into an 
uprising and violence against the Chinese military and ethnic Han Chinese.  
Beijing in turn accused Tibetans of terrorism and of trying to disrupt the 2008 
Olympics with violence.

The accusation of violence “is official Chinese propaganda. In March 2008 
there was a global protest. Inspired by the Mahatma Gandhi and on the advice of 
the Dalai Lama it was supposed to be non-violent. Unfortunately, China’s 
propaganda machine created the impression that the protest was just violent. In 
fact, incidents that occurred after 14 March, when some Chinese-owned stores 
were set on fire and some ethnic Han Chinese were killed, were due to severe 
provocation. Chinese propaganda chose to show Tibetans’ ‘violence’, but the 
world was able to see that Tibetan demonstrations were non-violent.”

According to Tenzin, China should draw some lessons from the demonstrations 
and violence in Urumqi.

“The frustrations of Tibetans are mounting; we are getting increasingly tired 
with Chinese insincerity in solving the Tibetan issue,” Tenzin said.

“Beijing should try to negotiate with the Dalai Lama and find a solution 
whilst he is still alive. None of us can predict what will happen after his 
death. So far he has preached and called for non-violence, but we do not know 
what will eventually happen. . . .”
