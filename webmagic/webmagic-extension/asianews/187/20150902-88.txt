Bangkok (AsiaNews / Agencies) - Thai police have arrested a second suspect in 
thebomb attack 

 two weeks ago in central Bangkok. It is the second arrest after that of August 
29.

According to Thai authorities, the man would have a key role in the terrorist 
act, even if they have not revealed whether he placed the bomb that killed 20 
people and injured more than 100. Three other suspects, including a woman 
Muslim, are still at large.

Prime Minister Prayut Chan o-cha said the arrested man "is not an ethnic Thai 
and was stopped at the checkpoint in Sa Kaeo", on the eastern border of the 
country. Probably added the former general, "he was trying to escape."

Local media reported that the man is a 25 year-old Chinese national, from 
Uyghur Autonomous Region Xinjiang. This has once again led to suspicions that 
the attack is Muslims revenge against the government in Bangkok. At the 
beginning of July, nearly 100 Uyghurs were repatriated to China by force by the 
Thai authorities. The man stopped had a passport with the name Yusufu Mieraili.

 Just one day after a number of police pocketed the ransom 

 for progress made in the investigation, Thai police officers transferred 22 
agents from checkpoints on the borders accused of negligence. Six of the 
transferred worked in Sa Kaeo. "It was my decision - said Somyot Pumpanmuang 
police chief - because foreigners have been able to illegally enter, without 
strict controls".
