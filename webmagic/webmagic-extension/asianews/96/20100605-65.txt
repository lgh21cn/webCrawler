Beijing (AsiaNews / Agencies) - Thousands of tourists flocked to Tiananmen 
Square yesterday, to Beijing, to mark the 21st anniversary of the massacre of 
1989. Chinese security forces have guarded the area, but the police presence 
was less than last year, when the square was reinforced and inaccessible to 
foreign journalists. Ding Zilin, leader of the Tiananmen Mothers, was able to 
provide a brief public ceremony to remember relatives killed in a suburb of the 
capital.

On the evening of June 3 Ding Zilin, a professor and Chinese politician, held 
a function Muxidi, a suburb of Beijing, to remember her son killed the night of 
June 3, 1989.The young man was killed while he went to Tiananmen Square, to 
join the protesters of the democratic movement.The police have prevented five 
other people in participating in a simple ceremony and imposed three conditions 
on the leaders of the Tiananmen Mothers: Do not display banners, no crowds for 
the commemoration, no interviews with foreign media.

Government officials followed the woman and her husband for the duration of 
the function. However, Ding and her husband were able to present photographs of 
10 victims of Tiananmen Square, including that of their son. The couple also 
left their ceremonial offerings and held a short speech, without causing the 
authorities to intervene.

Bao Tong, political secretary to Zhao Ziyang,  and director of political 
reform also spoke out about the events in Tiananmen Square. "The massacre of 
June 4 was the abolition of the common people, who opposed corruption." The 
former Communist leader said that "corruption was protected by the state army 
". Bao Tong and Zhao Ziyang, against the massacre, were then removed from their 
positions, isolated and sentenced to prison terms. Thus the path of political 
reforms designed to separate party politics from government was interrupted. 
This decision also prevented any real development in China, despite claims 
launched by the Communist government.

However, the Chinese censors seem to have eased since last year.  On the 
twentieth anniversary of the massacre, in fact, the government prevented access 
to the square to foreign media and nervousness among officials was obvious. 
Yesterday Tiananmen was guarded by a handful of uniformed police, aided by 
several hundred volunteers, wearing a shirt with the logo of the Beijing 
Olympics.

However, the arrests of activists and protesters have taken place.  Su Yutong, 
environmentalist, was detained by plainclothes police as she tried to place a 
bouquet of flowers at the foot of the monument of the People's Heroes in the 
centre of the square. The woman was questioned for six hours, then brought home.

Previously the government had shut internet down, stepping up censorship of 
sites which speak of the events of Tiananmen. Several activists, finally, are 
still under surveillance or forced house arrest.
