Urumqi (AsiaNews/Agencies) – More unrest broke out in Urumqi, capital of 
Xinjiang, scene of violence clashes in the past few days between the local 
Muslim Uyghur minority and Chinese security forces. Two ethnic Uyghur men were 
killed by police and a third one was injured. But China’s official media 
continue to claim that violence is caused by an “orchestrated campaign” which 
is also responsible for demonstrations in front Chinese embassies in Europe and 
the United States. 
A spokesman for the Xinjiang Autonomous Region said that police had to move in 
today to stop an attack by three Uyghurs against a fourth one. During their 
intervention police shot two men to death and seriously injured a third.

Unofficial sources claim that police fired at a group of Uyghurs armed with 
knives and rods who had attacked the police.

In the meantime Urumqi remains under tight police control. Police issued new 
measures to enforce law and order. They include a ban on carrying knives and 
sticks in the street, shouting slogans, waving banners or handing out flyers.

In Turkey, Norway, Germany and the Netherlands demonstrators threw eggs, 
Molotov cocktails and stones at Chinese embassies and consulates.

Xinhua, China’s official news agency, reported that unrest in Xinjiang and 
protests in front of China’s diplomatic missions appeared “well-orchestrated” 
by “supporters of the East Turkestan”.

It blamed the unrest on the World Uyghur Congress, an organisation that 
represents Uyghurs outside of China.

The official death toll stands at 184, including 137 ethnic Han Chinese and 46 
Muslim Uyghurs. About 1,700 people were injured.

Dissident groups in exile claim instead that hundreds of Muslims died during 
the clashes.
