Urumqi (AsiaNews) - The Chinese government has restricted the practice of 
ritual fasting of Ramadan for Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. Public officials, 
members of the local Communist Party members, students and children of the 
north-western province "should not fast and should not take part in the 
religious activities". The decision was published on various government 
websites of the area, one of the most turbulent in the country.

There are about nine million Turkic-speaking ethnic Muslim Uighur in Xinjiang, 
who resent the Communist domination and invasion of Han Chinese sent by the 
government to try to make them a minority. Although always rejecting 
accusations of religious interference, Beijing has imposed many restrictions on 
religious practice in the area under the guise of the fight against Islamic 
terrorism.

Ahmatjian Tohti, an official of the municipality of Tiekeqi, made it clear in 
a public meeting that members of local government "should forcibly students, 
members of administrations and minors who want to enter the mosque" during the 
holy month. Thisbegan yesterday across the Muslim world 

, it is one of the "five pillars" of Islam and involves in various capacities 
around 1.6 billion people around the world.

The local executive is also targeting restaurants and grocery stores in areas 
with a Muslim majority which usually close during the fasting hours. On the 
website of the government of the autonomous county of Qapqal has stated that 
these "must however remain open, so that the great majority of the population 
can have normal access to places of refreshment."
