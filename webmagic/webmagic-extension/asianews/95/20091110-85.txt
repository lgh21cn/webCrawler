Washington (AsiaNews/Agencies) – The US government has urged China on Monday to 
ensure fair trials after nine people were executed over ethnic unrest. This has 
thrown the spotlight on human rights ahead of President Barack Obama's 18 
November visit to mainland China. Twenty more people have been sentenced to 
death for the same reasons. 
Chinese authorities announced yesterday that nine members of the Uighur 
minority were executed for their action during violent disorders that broke out 
last July in Xinjiang Province. More than 200 people died during the incident, 
which was followed by a large number of police arrests.

The death penalties were carried out “with the approval of the Supreme Court," 
China’s official news agencyXinhua reported. It was not clear when the 
executions took place.

All nine had been convicted on murder charges and other crimes, Xingua said. 
Another 20 were formally charged with causing the death of 18 people during the 
unrest.

“The US government continues to urge China to handle all detentions and 
judicial processes relating to the Urumqi [Xinjiang’s capital] violence in a 
transparent manner,” State Department spokesman Ian Kelly told reporters.

“We also urge China to ensure that the legal rights of all Chinese citizens 
are respected in accordance with international standards of due process.”

This stance represents a shift in policy towards China by the Obama 
administration. The new president had avoided meeting the Dalai Lama during his 
trip to the United States. Now with this warning, Washington is indicating that 
human rights and other ethical issues will be on the table when Obama meets Hu 
Jintao.

Obama will talk about religious freedom, the plight of Tibet, and other human 
rights issues with Hu, according to Jeffrey Bader, the US president's senior 
director for Asian Affairs on the National Security Council.

“The president will raise human rights concerns directly with President Hu in 
his meetings,” Bader said. “The kind of issues that are on our minds are issues 
of freedom of expression, access to information, freedom of religion, rule of 
law.”
