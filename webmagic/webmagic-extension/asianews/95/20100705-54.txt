Urumqi (AsiaNews/Agencies) – Xinjiang’s capital of Urumqi is calm, unnaturally 
so, on the first anniversary of the crackdown that left hundreds of ethnic 
Uyghurs dead or injured. Eager to avoid a repeat of last year’s unrest, Chinese 
authorities have deployed thousands of police, many trucked in from 
neighbouring provinces, and installed 40,000 security cameras throughout the 
city. 
The unrest left nearly 200 people dead and 1,700 injured. It is not known how 
many were arrested, but Uighur dissidents put the number in the tens of 
thousands.  

On 5 July 2009, following a protest dispersed by police, young Uyghur men 
attacked neighbourhoods inhabited by ethnic Han Chinese who have settled in the 
province.

The next day, Han Chinese retaliated in what became China’s worst ethnic 
clashes in decades.

On Saturday, Amnesty International issued a statement questioning China’s 
official version of events, saying that it is not clear how many people were 
killed or by whom.

In camera trials convicted 198 people, allegedly for their involvement in the 
riots. Of these, 26 were sentenced to death. At least, nine have already been 
executed.

For Uyghur resistance leader Rebiya Kadeer, who lives in exile in the United 
States after barely avoiding the death penalty herself, the free world knows 
what is happening in Xinjiang but does nothing to avoid annoying Beijing.

In the city of Urumqi itself, residents are reporting an unnaturally calm, 
saying that Chinese authorities are telling ethnic Uyghurs to stay indoors.
