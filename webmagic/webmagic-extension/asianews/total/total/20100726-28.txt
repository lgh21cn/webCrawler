Beijing (AsiaNews / Agencies) - In early July China announced fresh investment 
to the tune of 100 billion dollars for 23 infrastructure projects "to promote 
rapid and healthy development of western areas”, which lag behind the rich 
eastern coastal regions. Experts are arguing over what model of development 
will be pursued.

The gap between the two parts of the country also has recent historical 
reasons: in 1978 the leader Deng Xiaoping opened China to the industrial 
development and trade especially favouring the coastal areas with roads, 
railways, and hydroelectric power stations. The western regions constitute 71% 
of the territory but are home to only 28% of the population. They have plenty 
of energy and precious minerals, essential for the development of the country.

Now Beijing says it wants to achieve roads, railways, airports, coal mines, 
power stations in the West to attract foreign investment, increase vocational 
education and encourage the return home of migrants who now have to seek work 
in Coastal cities. The Commission for National Development and Reform (Csnr) 
explained that the projects will be developed primarily in Tibet, Xinjiang and 
Inner Mongolia but also in Yunnan and Sichuan. There are tax exemptions for 
projects involving coal, oil and gas. 

Du Ying, vice president of Csnr appearing on television to explain the 
project, nevertheless stresses, which a robust growth is already in place in 
the West, reaching 11.9% in the last year. He adds that over the past 10 years, 
the railway capacity has increased by 160%, 280% that of highways, the energy 
capacity by 550%. Fixed investment came to 3,600 billion yuan (360 billion 
euros). Although the per capita gross domestic product rose in the west to1, 
933 dollars per year in 2008, just 41.9% compared to the east and accounts for 
only 17.8% of national GDP.

The government also hopes, , to stem the autonomist aspirations and protests 
in areas like Xinjiang and Tibet through better economic wellbeing and 
continuing to encourage the mass immigration of ethnic Han, who are often 
favoured in positions of power.

Experts say that, however, Beijing appears to want to replicate the 
development model implemented in the east, which has brought prosperity but 
also serious social and environmental problems, with tens of millions of 
migrants in cities forced to live as second-class citizens, the widespread 
pollution of air and water, poisoning of soil and desertification of entire 
areas. Above all, China does not appear to have any plans to resolve ethnic 
tensions and seems to think that economic development will eliminate all other 
problems.

Instead, scholars explain that, as in the case of Tibet and Xinjiang, 
development has benefited only small sections of the population, mostly ethnic 
Han, increasing the gap and contrasts with the local ethnic groups.
