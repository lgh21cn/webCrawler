Beijing (AsiaNews) - China has launched a new campaign of repression against 
the Uyghur ethnic minority to oppose any separatist movement and keep the 
democratic wave that is passing through the Middle East and North Africa, out 
of its territory.

The warning comes from well known Chinese dissident Rebiya Kadeer who, during 
a meeting with Australian parliamentarians, denounced "new violent and 
repressive measures" against the minority, which lives in the northern province 
of Xinjiang.

According to Kadeer - invited to speak at a parliamentary committee in 
Canberra despite objections from Beijing - China "is afraid of what's happening 
in the world. What happened in Egypt and Tunisia sent shock waves through the 
Chinese leadership that people's patience could run out and that people will 
one day rise up and challenge the authority of the regime "

It should be also considered that the Uyghur are a Turkic-speaking Muslim 
minority, who define themselves as "almost Middle Eastern" and refer to their 
own territory as "East Turkestan". In fact, by language, appearance, religion 
and customs, the Uyghur have absolutely nothing to do with the Han ethnic group 
that predominates in the country. Kadeer, arrested several times and even 
sentenced to death by the central government in Beijing, refutes charges that 
she is a separatist, instead claiming that she is fighting for the preservation 
of the Uyghur language and culture, that China is bent on wiping out.

The visit to Australia has angered the government of China, which in 2009 had 
asked Canberra not to grant the activist a visa labelling her "a dangerous 
separatist." According to the Communist Party, she is behind the riots of July 
2009, when in Urumqi - the capital of Xinjiang - the Uyghur launched protests 
asking for more autonomy.
For Kadeer, "Although China has changed its tactics, China has not changed its 
assaults upon Uygur people's religious beliefs, cultural identities, freedom of 
speech and economic life, which are central to the Chinese government's project 
of speedy assimilation of our people in China".
