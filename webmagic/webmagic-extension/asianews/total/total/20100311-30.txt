Beijing (AsiaNews / Agencies) - In Tibet, "there is no serious problem, 
despite what the Dalai Lama says." This is the declaration of the new president 
of the Autonomous Region of China Padma Choling, refuting accusations made 
yesterday by the Tibetan leader in exile, according to who Beijing “is trying 
to wipe out Buddhism. "Yesterday, on the 51st anniversary of the uprising of 
1959 and the second anniversary of the 2008 protests that occurred in many 
parts of China that is home to Tibetan people, there were no reported incidents.
 

"In Lhasa - said Padma, the so-called " hawk " of the Tibetan Administration - 
you can see monks and nuns everywhere. In Tibet there are about 1,700 religious 
sites home to 46 thousand monks."

In his speech the Nobel Peace Laureate accused the Chinese central government 
of having reduced the monks to a state of "semi-slavery" and expressed his 
support for the peoples of Eastern Turkestan - the Uyghur, considered a 
separatist group by Beijing - and for those intellectuals who criticize the 
regime. This is a clear reference to Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese dissident author 
of "Charter '08" who has been sentenced to 11 years in prison.

The regional president criticized the Dalai Lama for having called the Chinese 
region of Xinjiang "East Turkistan", using the term coined by local 
anti-Chinese nationalists. “He should not foment rebellion in our country", 
said the local leader. According to Tibetan exiles, about 200 people died in 
the 2008 protests while the government says that the victims were "little more 
than twenty."

The central government has also attacked the Buddhist leader. According to the 
Foreign Ministry spokesman in Beijing, Qin Gan, "the Dalai Lama destorts" the 
real situation in Tibet. Furthermore, according to Qin, his support for the 
Uyghur "is a demonstration of his desire to harm the national unity of China 
and his separatism".
