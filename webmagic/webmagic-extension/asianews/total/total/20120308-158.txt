Beijing (AsiaNews) - The recent wave of self-immolations "will not stop 
development" in Tibet, said Li Changping, a senior party official in Sichuan 
province, adding that "separatist activities by the Dalai Lama clique are 
doomed to fail." He spoke on the sidelines of the annual session of the 
National People's Congress (NPC) currently underway in Beijing. Xinjiang party 
boss echoed such sentiments, saying that in his province "terrorists" would be 
stopped by any means.

China's parliament opened its annual session on Monday in the Great Hall of 
the People on Tiananmen Square. Attended by some 3,000 delegates, the meetings 
in the huge hall are often viewed as useless because the NPC rubberstamps 
decisions already made by the politburo. However, it is an important catwalk 
for provincial leaders to showcase their achievements to national leaders (and 
media).

Not surprisingly, some Tibetan leaders use the venue. "Some of the suicides 
are committed by clerics returning to lay life," said Wu Zegang, the 
government's top administrator in Aba Prefecture, as he spoke about the recent 
spate of self-immolations in Tibet and Tibetan districts. "They [the monks] all 
have criminal records or" have been involved in "suspicious activities. They 
have a very bad reputation in society".

Such "people can neither represent all Tibetans nor stop the stably-developing 
trend in these regions," said Li Changping, a senior party official in Sichuan 
province.

Things are not much better in Xinjiang, where for years indigenous Uyghur have 
been fighting for autonomy against the Communist central government.

The local party boss, Zhang Chunxian, said that terrorism in the province 
would be wiped out. To do this, he urged neighbouring countries to stop 
terrorists from crossing into China.

In his view, the conflict in Xinjiang "is not a religious issue, nor an ethnic 
issue". In reality, "The terrorists are basically against humanity. They are 
brutal to innocent people, including the elderly and even boys and girls. We 
are determined to fight back against these violent terrorists."
