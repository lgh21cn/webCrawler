 Sharif in Beijing to bring Arab oil to China
<\TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
From now until 8 July, Pakistani Prime Minister will be in Beijing to discuss energy and investments. The construction of a road-and-rail corridor between Kashgar (Xinjiang) and Gwadar (Baluchistan) on the Arabian Sea is crucial. This way, Pakistan could solve its energy crisis, but in return, it will likely have to "stop" the emergence of Islamic fundamentalism.

Islamabad (AsiaNews/Agencies) - Energy, transport and investment are on the 
agenda Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is taking with him as he begins 
today a six-day visit to China (3-8 July). His ultimate aim is to revive his 
country's economy, which has been paralysed by an energy crisis and violent 
Islamic fundamentalism. The construction of a road and rail corridor between 
Kashgar (in the western Chinese province of Xinjiang) and the port of Gwadar 
(Baluchistan province) on the Arabian Sea is part of the broader picture.

The fact that Sharif chose Beijing for his first official trip abroad after 
his victory in the 11 May elections is significant. During his stay in China, 
he is expected to meet at least three members of the Politburo, namely 
President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang.

The Kashgar-Gwadar project is of great interest to both countries. "Sharif 
knows that Gwadar has significant geopolitical and economic importance for 
China," said Rashid Ahmed Khan, a professor of international relations at the 
University of Sargodha in Punjab. "It can provide a short route for Chinese 
crude imports from the Middle East and for its exports to the region."

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying agrees. The project "will help both 
countries as well as the development of the whole region," she said.

In addition to trade, many analysts see the port of Gwadar as part of China's 
plan to increase its naval power and influence in the Indian Ocean, considered 
the future centre of international energy exchanges.

The Kashgar-Gwadar line starts in the heart of Xinjiang province and cross 
into Baluchistan, a desert province bordering Iran and Afghanistan, and among 
the poorest in Pakistan.

Both areas have often been the scene of sectarian clashes. In recent days, 
fresh unrest 

 broke out in Xinjiang between indigenous ethnic Uyghur (who are Turkic and 
Muslim) and Han Chinese, the majority in China. Beijing blamed the attacks on 
Islamic extremists trained in Pakistan, in camps run by the East Turkestan 
Islamic Movement.

Baluchistan has been in the hands of paramilitary forces for decades. The 
exploitation of gas and mineral resources by the government has unleashed 
attacks by extremist and separatist movements, as well as Taliban groups.

If approved, the project might force Pakistan to find a final settlement to 
the fundamentalist emergency that has ravaged the country, a problem many blame 
on the central government in Islamabad.

This view is share by Afghan Army Chief General Sher Mohammad Karimi who said 
that Pakistan controlled and gave shelter to Taliban leaders, deliberately 
unleashing fighters on Afghanistan.

"If [Pakistan] put pressure on [the Taliban] leadership or convinced them what 
to do, that can help a lot," he added.
