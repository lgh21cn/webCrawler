Beijing ( AsiaNews / Agencies ) - At least 16 people were killed in a violent 
clash near Kashgar . The news was reported today by Tianshan.net, the official 
website of the Xinjiang government.

 Two of those killed were policemen, while the other 14 are defined as 
"violent thugs" . According to the site, the police were looking for criminal 
suspects in Shufu County, when they were attacked by "thugs " armed with 
explosives and knives .

 While the police were trying to arrest one of the suspects, the "terrorists" 
went into action.

 Two of the attackers were arrested.

 Xinjiang is a very restless region.  The Uyghur population that inhabits it, 
Turkic speaking and Muslim, accuses Beijing of wanting to colonize them with a 
massive migration of Han Chinese and with stringent military and economic 
control.

 Uyghur groups are fighting for the independence of the region they call "East 
Turkestan ." China accuses them of being terrorists and keeps strict control of 
Islamic schools and religious practice .

 Last October , a car bomb exploded in Tiananmen Square, killing five people 

 . According to Beijing, the incident was a Uyghur "terrorist attack" .
