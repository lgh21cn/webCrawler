Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) – Xinjiang wants to quickly pass special laws to 
deal with separatism in the autonomous region, Chinese newspapers reported 
yesterday without any explanation. This is a sign that the protests that broke 
out on 5 July will be met with harsh measures. Officially 197 people died 
during the violent clashes and more 1,700 were wounded. 
Analysts note that China already has some of the toughest anti-secession laws 
on the books; any new law will simply give more powers to the police and 
increase already harsh penalties, thus further limiting civil liberties.

Speaking to Xinhua Eligen Imibakhi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
Xinjiang Regional People's Congress, said that this month’s protests were 
caused by the “three forces,” namely “extremism, separatism and terrorism”.

For years China has used this unholy trinity to justify its persecution of 
Uyghurs, charging them with being dangerous terrorists.

Chinese authorities insist that demonstrations in early July were organised by 
secessionist groups, not the spontaneous action of ordinary people.

The mouthpiece of the Communist Party, the People’s Daily, yesterday blamed 
foreign groups like the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress (WUC) and exiled 
Uyghyr leader Rebiya Kadeer for masterminding the violence, an accusation which
Xinhua reprinted today. 

Uyghurs have dismissed Chinese charges, saying the protests were peaceful 
until police intervened.

Instead WUC representative in Japan Ilham Mahmut called on China to allow a 
third party to hold an independent investigation into the incidents.

Meanwhile Xingjian’s capital of Urumqi remains an ethnically-divided powder 
keg.

Uyghurs have become a minority in their own city, restricted to the poorest 
neighbourhoods.

Ethnic Han Chinese now make up more than 70 per cent of the city’s 2.3 million 
residents, encouraged to settle in this faraway outpost through incentives and 
promises of positions of power.

The violent demonstrations have traumatised both groups; each claiming that 
media coverage of the events has distorted what actually happened.

Officially, 1,400 Uyghurs have been arrested for their involvement in the 
protests, a figure treated with scorn by Uyghurs, some of whom claim that as 
many 20,000 have been detained, including innocent passers-by caught up in the 
events.
