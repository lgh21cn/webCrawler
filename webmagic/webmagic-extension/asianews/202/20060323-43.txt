Xiantao (AsiaNews/CAA) Â– Chinese police arrested a Protestant pastor, Lian 
Changnian, on 20 March, while he was leading a bible study in a house church in 
Xintao, Hubei. He was arrested in front of around 100 worshippers and was taken 
to a prison in the city, where he is still detained. This was revealed by the 
China Aid Association (CAA), a US-based non-governmental organization lobbying 
for religious freedom in China.

The same organisation said another 15 Protestant house church leaders are also 
in prison; they were arrested on 13 March in Wen County in Henan. Among them is 
a 15-year-old Evangelist.

After arresting them, police beat them with electric batons, and one of the 
15, Pastor Li Gongshe, had to be taken to Mengzhou hospital for urgent 
treatment of a broken rib that was preventing him from breathing. The pastor is 
still in hospital, and there is no news of six of the rest. The accusation 
against them all is: "membership of an illegal evil cult".

Two renowned Chinese laywers, have accepted to take the case: Zhang is 
director of the Jingding law firm in Beijing and Fan is professor of 
Constitutional Law at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Last month, a campaign targeted unofficial churches in Xinjiang, leading to 
the arrest of dozens of Christian leaders. On Monday, another two people were 
arrested in Shanxi, while another three pastors were apprehended at the 
beginning of March.

Beijing allows the practice of Protestant Christianity only within the 
Movement of the Three Autonomies (MTA), born in 1950 after Mao seized power and 
the expulsion of foreign missionaries and church leaders, including Chinese 
ones.

Official statistics reveal that there are 10 million official Protestants in 
China, all belonging to the MTA. Unofficial Protestants, who meet in 
unregistered "house churches", are estimated to reach more than 50 million.
