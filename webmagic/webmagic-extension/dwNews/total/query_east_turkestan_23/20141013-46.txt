 On Monday, a court in the city of Kashgar also handed out heavy sentences to 
dozens of others, saying the accused were found guilty of a number of crimes 
including terrorism, murder, kidnap, and making explosives.

 A further 15 people were given suspended death sentences; nine got life in 
jail, whereas 20 people received sentences ranging from four to 20 years. 
According to the Reuters news agency, judging by their names, all these people 
belong to the minority Muslim Uighur community.

 Beijing blames the Uighur Islamists for orchestrating the July 28 attacks 

 in which 59 knife-wielding "terrorists" were gunned down by security forces in 
the towns of Elixku and Huangdi.

 Hundreds of people have been killed in China's restive northwestern region in 
the past two years, mostly in clashes between Uighurs and the ethnic Han 
Chinese. The central government in Beijing also accuses Xinjiang's Islamist 
militants â€“ who it says wants to establish an independent East Turkestan state 
- of attacks in other parts of the country. A market attack in May in the 
region's capital Urumqi left 39 dead. In September, the police shot dead 40 
rioters, including some suicide bombers, after explosions in Luntai county.

 According to Amnesty International, a total 778 executions were carried out 
in 2013 across the world 

. Amnesty believes that the Chinese government alone carries out more than 778 
executions, but excludes China from its annual count citing a lack of reliable 
information.

Policewoman killed

 The Chinese state media reported on Monday that two "thugs" had stabbed a 
policewoman to death in Xinjiang's Pishan county. The assailants on motorbikes 
used sharp weapons to "cruelly attack and kill" the lady, said the China 
Central Television (CCTV). The attack took place on Friday, however, the media 
only reported it on Monday.

 CCTV did not specify the ethnicity of the policewoman but said that the 
two-month pregnant woman's name suggested she was an Uighur.

 Exiled Uighur groups and rights activists claim that Beijing's repressive 
policies in Xinjiang 

 are responsible for the unrest in the region, an accusation the government 
denies.

 In September, a Chinese court sentenced prominent Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti 

 to life in prison for "separatism."
