The drill has been nicknamed "Hand-in-Hand 2007". It is aimed at tackling what 
China has termed the "three evil forces of separatism, religious extremism and 
terrorism".

The week-long exercise in the Chinese south-western province of Yunnan 
involves almost a hundred troops from each country, who will all take part in 
mock combats against terrorists.

Senior military officers will observe the exercises and assess the operational 
methods and capabilities of the two sides, especially their capacity to deal 
with surprises.

The Chinese foreign ministry has stated the aim of the joint anti-terror 
exercise as being to "strengthen mutual understanding and trust" between India 
and China and their two armies, as well as to enhance their co-operation 
combating terrorism.

Potential terrorist threats

Hong Kong-based defence expert Pinkov explained there was "a necessity for 
such joint-military exercises because both China and India face potential 
threats from terrorist attacks."

Both countries have volatile border regions and their governments are 
struggling with minority groups campaigning for greater autonomy or outright 
independence.

The Chinese government has come down very hard on Uighur Muslims campaigning 
for an independent East Turkestan -- Beijing says their so-called "violent 
separatist activities" must be defeated.

"All-weather relationship"

Whereas the Indian government faces difficulties from separatists in its 
north-eastern region and also faces cross-border terrorism from Pakistan.

Pakistan is China's "all-weather" friend and this relationship has caused a 
great deal of tension in China-India ties for decades. But over recent years, 
China and India have taken efforts to develop their trade and diplomatic 
relations.

Pinkov explained such "joint military exercises like this are necessary for 
China and India to establish mutual trust. From the Indian point of view, China 
gave more support to Pakistan in the India-Pakistan conflict. Pakistan has held 
military exercises with China. India realises that that after the nuclear 
contest between India and Pakistan broke out, China's position became more 
neutral."

Himalayan border dispute

For the purpose of this joint drill, a lingering border dispute between the 
two sides has also been played down. Both India and China lay rival claim to 
Himalayan territory.

New Delhi says China occupies almost 40,000 square kilometres of its 
territory, whereas Beijing claims 90,000 square kilometres are actually part of 
China. In 1962, this border dispute was the trigger for a short but bitter war 
between the two countries.

Although the dispute has yet to be resolved, both China and India think it 
should not be an obstacle to bilateral relations.

Strategic competition

Major General Afsar Karim, now retired from the Indian army, hailed the 
exercise: "Earlier the two sides were always at war but this joint drill shows 
that they want to work together and it's good news."

However, Karim pointed out that the fundamental difference between the two 
Asian giants lies elsewhere: "There have been some improvements in ties between 
India and China. But we must understand that the problem between the two 
countries is strategic. They are strategic competitors and this has nothing to 
do with the joint drill."

The success of this week's drill will determine whether a full-scale joint 
military exercise between India and China is launched. However, experts think 
it is still a long way off.
