 Gauthier, who is based in Beijing and works for the news magazine "L'Obs," is 
due to leave the Chinese capital on a 1 a.m. flight on Friday (Thursday, 1500 
UTC).

 Speaking ahead of her departure, she told the AFP news agency that she has 
been left with "a very strong feeling of surreality" on her last night in 
Beijing.

 Chinese authorities refused to renew Gauthier's press card 

 earlier this month, leaving the journalist unable to apply for a visa. The 
move came in the aftermath of her essay, "After the attacks [in Paris], Chinese 
solidarity is not without ulterior motives," published on November 8.

 Her report questioned China's motives in expressing sympathy for the victims 
of the Paris attacks, criticizing that they were calulated to link Beijing's 
harsh policies in Xinjiang - where most of China's ethnic Uighur Muslim 
minority lives - with the fight against global terrorism.

 Chinese officials said the report justified violence against the government. 
"The article criticized China's counterterrorism efforts and denigrated and 
slandered Chinese policies. It provoked the strong indignation of the Chinese 
public," the foreign ministry said earlier this month.

Death threats

 Gauthier's essay also triggered abusive comments from social media users in 
China and was condemned by the state-run "Global Times" and "China Daily."

 "They wanted me to apologize publicly for my wrongs," Gauthier said, "But my 
wrongs were all invented by the Global Times."

 After receiving death threats, Gauthier said she didn't contact authorities 
as she "did not expect the police to take the case seriously."

 During a press conference on Wednesday, however, Foreign Ministry 
Spokesperson Lu Kang rejected Gauthier's claims.

 "Ursula Gauthier should go to the police if she really believes she is 
threatened," Lu said. "Instead she is flaunting it in front of the press which 
is rather unusual, unless she is doing it for other purposes."

French media uproar

 Back home in France, Gauthier's expulsion has sparked outrage among the 
French media, who have condemned the "abusive treatment" of the journalist.

 French daily "Le Monde" also criticized French authorities, describing their 
"lacking determination" in Gauthier's case as "irresponsible."

 Press organization Reporters Without Borders also denounced the incident, 
calling it "media lynching" and a "campaign of defamation and intimidation" 
against Gauthier. According to the organization's press freedom index, China 
sits in position 176 out of 180 countries.

 The last time China refused to renew a foreign reporter's press credentials 
was in 2012 when Melissa Chan, a reporter for Al Jazeera, was accussed of 
violating Chinese regulations. At the time, Chan's expulsion was the first such 
case in 13 years.
