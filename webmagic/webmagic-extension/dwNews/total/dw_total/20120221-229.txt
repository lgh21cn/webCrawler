 The man slated to become China's next leader, Xi Jinping, was in Turkey on 
Tuesday for talks with President Abdullah Gul.

 The visit marks the rise of Turkish clout on the international stage and 
recognition of the country's role in maintaining stability in the Middle East.

 "In today's complex and changing international situation, the enrichment of 
the strategic cooperation between China and Turkey is to the benefit of both 
countries, now and in the long term," Xi told the Turkey Sabah newspaper in an 
interview.

 "A member of the G20 with a growing economy and an important country in the 
Middle East, Turkey has for a long time tried to bring stability and 
development to the region and played an active role in trying to solve 'hot' 
issues," Xi said, citing Afghanistan and the Iranian nuclear dispute among 
others.

Turkey, China eye closer cooperation

Xi Jinping, the expected next leader of China, is making a key visit to 
Turkey. While the emerging global powers aim at developing strategic ties, the 
crisis in Syria has offered a test case for their cooperation. (19.02.2012)
  
 But Xi's arrival has already been marked by protests by dozens of ethnic 
Uighurs, who desecrated a poster of the senior official and set fire to two 
Chinese flags. The demonstrators were venting anger over Beijing's treatment of 
Uighur populations in China. Turkey is also home to a large Uighur community.

 On Wednesday, Xi is to attend a business forum in Istanbul, where he is 
likely to be assailed by exporters eager to bridge a wide trade gap between the 
countries.

 China sells some $21.6 billion worth of goods to Turkey, whilst Turkey sends 
only $2.5 billion worth to its Asian partner.

 Xi is wrapping up a world tour that saw him meet with US President Barack 
Obama in Washington and most recently travel to Ireland.
