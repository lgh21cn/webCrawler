German engineering conglomerate Linde said Wednesday it had won a contract 
worth 140 million euros ($172 million) to build the world's largest ethylene 
plant in China. The contract was awarded by PetroChina international and was 
signed by the two companies on Sunday, Linde said in a statement. The plant, 
which would go onstream in the second half of 2008, will produce one million 
tons of ethylene each year and 500,000 tons of propylene, Linde said. It will 
be situated in Dushanzi in Xinjiang, north west China.
