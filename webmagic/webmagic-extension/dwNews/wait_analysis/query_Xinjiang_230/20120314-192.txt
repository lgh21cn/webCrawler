China's National People's Congress draws to a close
<\TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
China's parliamentary session closed with the prime minister calling for political and economic reforms. Experts doubt, however, that there will be much change in the run-up to the 18th Party Congress in fall.

 China's economic growth was high on the agenda at this year's People's 
Congress. In his closing speech, Premier Wen Jiabao said on Wednesday that the 
country must embrace slower growth and bolder political reforms to keep its 
economy from faltering, while spreading wealth more evenly.

 He had opened the parliamentary session on March 5 by announcing a growth 
target of 7.5 percent for this year compared to the 8 percent that has been the 
goal for the past eight years. There was a belief earlier that if growth were 
lower, there would not be enough jobs created to preserve social stability. But 
the economy has continued to boom.
 

Wen Jiabao delivered his last government work report at this year's opening 
ceremony

Gu Xuewu from the Center for Global Studies in Bonn says that the lucky 
"Eight" is being dropped "to reduce overcapacities and optimize economic 
structures, which are China's most urgent challenges."

 "Eight percent growth is not needed at all to master the social challenges 
and create jobs," he insists.

 What is important is the quality of growth and its sustainability. Hong-Kong 
based political commentator Willy Lam says that the lower target is "realistic" 
considering unfavorable economic growth in the US and Europe, which has led to 
a drop in Chinese exports.

 He also says that the state investment programs that have driven much of the 
growth since the 2008 finance crisis are not "a long-term solution." Beijing 
wants to boost domestic demand now.

 China's defense budget has been increased by 11.2 percent for 2012. Analysts 
say China wants to expand its influence in Asia and to rival the US. "This is 
also true for military matters. The US has had to decrease its military 
expenditure because of its financial problems. This gives China a chance to 
catch up - especially regarding the navy and the air force."
 

Protesters were driven away from Tiananmen Square

Lam is worried about the fact that the budget for "preserving the country's 
stability, namely for the police and security forces, has been increased. He 
explains that 120,000 protests and riots are registered in China every year - 
300 a day. He says Beijing is boosting its police apparatus to keep the 
situation under control.

A 'lost decade'

 In Tibet and in Xinjiang, which is populated largely by Uighurs, the 
situation is particularly tense. However, this year's People's Congress has not 
revised minority policies as some intellectuals had called for.

 Gu Xuewu points out that it is not so easy to solve these problems but if 
there are no attempts to introduce reforms the resentment will only grow. "At 
some point the disruption could be so great that the current system cannot 
cope. The system is not as strong as it seems."
 

The People's Congress has almost 3,000 delegates

It does not look as if the bold reforms that many have called for will be 
implemented however. Analysts do not expect many significant changes over the 
next months despite Wen's insistence he wants to drive forward reforms during 
his last year in office.

 The Hong-Kong based journalist Bao Pu says the past decade has been "lost."

 "There have been no real reforms - only of the bureaucratic machine, but not 
of the governmental system as a whole."

 In any case, important decisions are not made by the People's Congress. All 
eyes are set on the 18th Party Congress later this year. Wen Jiabao and 
President Hu Jintao are due to hand over power to their successors, as are 
seven other members of the Politburo Standing Committee. The fight for these 
positions is going on behind the scenes and is particularly heated.
