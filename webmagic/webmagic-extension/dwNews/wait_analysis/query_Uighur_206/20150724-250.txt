 Former student co-leader Wu'er Kaixi, who fled China after its 1989 crackdown 
and later settled in Taiwan, launched his candidacy on Friday aimed at winning 
a legislative seat in Taichung, a major city on the island's west coast.

 Taiwan votes for a new parliament and a new president next January, with the 
ruling pro-China Nationalist Party or Kuomintang (KMT) on the back foot since 
its heavy losses in local elections last November.

 Wu'er Kaixi, now 47, with links to western China's Uighur peoples (pictured 
above), said he would take on the KMT, describing it as an "enormous monster," 
as part of his bid to "deepen democracy."
 

KTM candidate Hung is known as a straight talker

 Earlier this month, the Nationalists sought to end months of division by 
picking Hung Hsiu-chu as their presidential candidate. She is an advocate of 
closer ties with mainland China and is the current parliament's deputy speaker.

Her main challenger 
 will 
be Tsai Ing-wen, who is chairwoman of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party 
(DPP), which leans toward Taiwanese independence.

 Taiwan split from China in 1949 after a civil war and became self-ruling, but 
Beijing still sees the island aspart of its territory 

 awaiting reunification -- by force if necessary.

Trade deals triggered protest

 Relations have improved under current president Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT, 
leading to a number of trade deals but triggering growing public unease.

 Last November, thousands of young Taiwanese occupied the island's parliament 
in an unprecedented protest against a planned China-Taiwan trade pact.

 That sentiment was fueled by clashes between police and pro-democracy 
protestors in China-ruled Hong Kong.

 At his press conference, Wu'er Kaixi said China was the "home of my parents."

 "Taiwan is the home of my children," he added.

 Wu'er Kaixi fled China in 1989 after China's military crushed student 
protests on Beijing's Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds.

Wu're berated Li Peng

 He became the second most wanted student leader in China after he famously 
berated then-premier Li Peng during a televised meeting.

 Wu'er Kaixi married a Taiwanese woman and settled on the island in 1996.

 Also standing for the same seat in Taichung is the opposition DDP contender 
Chang Liao Wan-chien, a longtime city councilor in the island's third largest 
city.

 Both men agreed to run their campaigns of policy issues with no mud-slinging.
