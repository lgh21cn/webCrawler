Germany has indicated that it would be willing to take some of the terrorism 
suspects who would be released once a US detention center in Guantanamo, Cuba 
is closed. But first, German leaders want to assure themselves that the 
detainees do not pose a threat.

US Vice President Joe Biden recently indicated that the United States will 
turn to its allies to take on some of the remaining 245 prisoners, all of whom 
were picked up during the US war on terror.

"We will ask others to take responsibility for some of those now at 
Guantanamo, as we determine to close it," Biden said at a recent security 
conference in Munich, Germany.

Germany waiting for a request

The US has indicated that approximately 60 of the prisoners have been 
determined to not be terrorists. But they continue to be held as the US fears 
they would be tortured or killed if returned home.

Germany is waiting for the United States to present a more specific request 
for help before doing anything, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told the
Stuttgarter Nachrichten in an article published on Wednesday, Feb. 11. 

The US fears prisoners may be harmed if returned to their homes

"Our focus is on whether Germany's security is jeopardized," the Interior 
Ministry spokesman told the newspaper. "Nevertheless, we're waiting to see if 
there even are any requests from Washington."

Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has promised that each detainee will 
be "very thoroughly" investigated, according to the newspaper report.

But Germany still believes that the United States is legally responsible for 
taking in released detainees. Any reason for not wanting to do so needs to be 
thoroughly explained, the spokesperson said.

Sebastian Edathy, a leading Social Democrat on the issue, spoke out in favor 
of the government conducting thorough checks on individual detainees before 
allowing them into Germany, but told the newspaper it's important that "a 
presumption of innocence not be turned upside down."

A leader of the Green Party, Christian Stroebele, renewed calls for the 
detainees to be released as soon as possible. He finds it unacceptable that 
innocent prisoners would be left to languish in Guantanamo while politicians 
"argue over who is responsible" for them.

Help for the Uighurs

The end to a long imprisonment may soon be near

Germany seems most interested in helping Muslim Uighurs from far western 
China. The city of Munich, which has the biggest community of ethnic Uighurs 
outside China, has indicated it would be willing to host the 17 Guantanamo 
inmates when they are released.

All of the Uighurs have been cleared of terrorist activity, but Washington has 
been reluctant to repatriate them to China for fear they would be persecuted or 
tortured.

Although there has been no consensus from the European Union on how to deal 
with released Guantanamo detainees, several other European countries have 
indicated they would be willing to accept a small number of the released 
prisoners.
