The Swiss government said Wednesday it would allow two Chinese Guantanamo 
detainees to resettle in northwestern Switzerland, despite objections from 
China.

Beijing warned the Swiss government in early January that accepting the 
inmates, ethnic Uighurs and alleged terrorists in China, could sour relations 
between the two countries.

The Swiss Justice Ministry said it was aware of China's concerns but had 
decided to grant asylum to the men based on humanitarian grounds, adding that 
the men didn't represent a security risk.

"Today the Federal Council decided to admit for humanitarian reasons two 
Uighurs with Chinese citizenship, who have been imprisoned in Guantanamo for 
years by the United States without being charged with a crime nor condemned," 
it said.

Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said Switzerland has a "stable, good 
relationship with China, and we want to keep it that way."

In January, a Swiss parliamentary committee recommended not to accept the 
detainees, citing security fears after the attempted bombing of an American 
airliner on December 25.

The detainees, who are brothers, will be resettled in the canton of Jura. In 
January, an Uzbek became the first former Guantanamo inmate to be resettled in 
Switzerland. Widmer-Schlumpf said the country is not planning to take in any 
further detainees.
