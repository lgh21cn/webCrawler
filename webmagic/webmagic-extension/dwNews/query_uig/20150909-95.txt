 Thai police said on Wednesday that a foreign national  in last month's deadly bombing at a popular Hindu shrine in the capital, Bangkok, has admitted to handing the alleged bomber a backpack containing a bomb just before the blast took place.
 "This is the area where he met the man in a yellow shirt to exchange the backpack," national police spokesman Prawu Thavornsiri told reporters outside a Bangkok railway station, where police were carrying out a reenactment of the suspect's alleged movements before and after the bombing.
 A man wearing a yellow shirt was  apparently placing the backpack at the shrine moments before the blast.
 The suspect, 25-year-old Yusufu Mierili, whose name has appeared in several variants, is one of two foreign nationals detained under suspicion of involvement in  which killed 20 people, mostly ethnic Chinese tourists, at the well-known Erawan Shrine on the night of August 17.
 
 Mierili was arrested last week at the Thai-Cambodia border in possession of a Chinese passport. Police say he has admitted playing a central role in the attack, although his motive remains unclear.
 He has not yet been formally charged.
 Mierili told police he had brought the backpack from an apartment in the Nong Chok district on the edge of Bangkok.  in an apartment in Nong Chok during a raid on August 29 during which the other foreign suspect was arrested.
  put forward is that the attack may have been to avenge the forced repatriation by Thailand of 109 ethnic Uighurs to China in July.
 Police have said that the Chinese passport held by Mierili gave his birthplace as Xinjiang, home to the Uighur Muslim minority, which has long reported facing persecution in China.
 Public reenactments before the media are a common feature of Thai criminal investigations. Critics of the practice say they imply a suspect's guilt before the trial.
