A court in Oslo on Monday found two defendants guilty of hatching a bomb plot against the offices of a newspaper that published controversial cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.
Norwegian national Mikael Davud, 40, a member of China's Muslim Uighur community, was sentenced to seven year in prison. Shawan Sadek Bujak, 38, an Iraqi Kurd living in Norway, received a three-and-a-half-year term. 
The prosecution had asked for sentences of 11 and five years respectively for the two men, who had pleaded not guilty, on the grounds that they had plotted the attack in liaison with al Qaeda.
The court had heard that the men planned to use explosives at the offices of Danish daily newspaper Jyllands-Posten. The paper had caused offense across the Muslim world with a series of 12 cartoon drawings of the Muslim prophet in September 2005. 
Prosecutors said the men had later planned to murder Kurt Westergaard, the artist responsible for the most controversial of the drawings.

A third man, from Uzbekistan, was acquitted of the most serious charges. David Jakobsen was sentenced to four months behind bars for helping the two other men to obtain materials for their plot. However, the 33-year-old was freed on the basis of time served on remand.
David had confessed to planning an attack against Chinese interests in Norway, but not against the Danish newspaper. He said the idea had been his own and that he had tried to manipulate both Bujak and Jakobsen.
All three men were arrested in July 2010 after Norwegian security services uncovered a plot to make bombs using hydrogen peroxide-based chemicals.
