Seven "terrorists" have been shot dead in China's restive northwestern 
Xinjiang province. According to official media, members of a "terror gang," 
possibly influenced by Islamists, had kidnapped two people late Wednesday in 
the county of Pishan near the borders of India and Pakistan.

The two hostages were freed when police shot dead seven of the suspected 
kidnappers in a rescue mission, as reported by Chinese media. According to the 
account, police were forced to open fire after being shot at.

One police officer was also killed in the shootout and one was wounded. Four 
other suspects were wounded and taken into custody.

Unrest

An exile group referred to the incident as an act of desperation and protest 
by native Uighurs, who are the subject of religious repression and are facing a 
police crackdown in the northwestern region of China.

Uighurs demonstrate against repression

Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for an exile group named World Uighur Congress, told 
the French news agency AFP: "The local government recently started a 'strike 
hard' campaign, which resulted in the disappearances of several people. They 
were taken away by armed forces, who refused to say where they were."

Xinjiang is a resource-rich province and has seen bouts of violence between 
locals and the Chinese government, which tends to blame the unrest on religious 
extremism, terrorism and separatist elements.

Violence most recently flared up in Kashgar and Hotan in the summer of 2011, 
resulting in the death of 32 people. In September, four people were sentenced 
to death for the incidents.

Beijing reacts to such violence by increasing police presence, conducting 
raids, restricting or cutting communication lines, such as telephone and 
internet connections, and sometimes limiting the practice of Islam.
