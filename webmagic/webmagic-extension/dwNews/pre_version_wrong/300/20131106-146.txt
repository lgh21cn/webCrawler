 Officials said the explosions occurred early on Wednesday morning local time 
outside an office building of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist 
Party in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province.

 One person was killed in the blasts, and eight people injured, one of them 
seriously, according to official media.

 "Judging from the scattering of small metal balls, it is suspected that 
improvised bombs exploded," the state-run news agency Xinhua reported.

 Xinhua quoted residents as saying that there were as many as seven blasts.

Regular revenge attacks

 There was no information about the presumed target or perpetrators. However, 
the attack bore the hallmark of the kind of attack occasionally carried out in 
China by citizens angered at perceived injustices.

 Shanxi, which lies in China's coal belt, has a relatively large wealth divide 
between rich owners of mines and the poorer people who work them.

 Wednesday's incident comes after an attack in Beijing last week  

in which three people drove through crowds to Tiananmen Gate before setting 
their vehicle alight.

 Five people, including three inside the vehicle, were killed. The attack has 
been blamed on extremist separatists from the restive Xinjiang region, home to 
the mostly Muslim Uighur minority.
