 Flames and heavy smoke consumed the market place of Urumqi, the capital of 
China's restive Xinjiang region on Thursday following an attack.

 China's state-run Xinhua news agency said that more than 31 people had been 
killed and 90 injured.

 Around 7:50 a.m. (2350 UTC) on Thursday, unidentified assailants rammed two 
vehicles into the city's market place. They then threw explosive devices from 
the windows, according to Xinhua news agency.

 China's Ministry of Public Security has described the attack as a "serious 
violent terorist incident."

 Violence has plagued Xinjiang province, home to an ethnically diverse 
population comprised primarily ofMuslim Uighurs 

. Beijing has blamed the unrest on terrorists backed by foreigners, however 
rights groups cite cultural repression as the cause of the ethnic clashes in 
recent years.

 Earlier this month, Urumqi's southern train station (pictured above) was the 
scene of a bombing and knife attack on passengers 

. At least three people were killed and dozens more injured. The incident 
coincided with final day of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the region. 
He has called for more support for local police and a greater security for the 
people of the region.
