 Police officers in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang shot and killed 
three Uighur men carrying knives and injured a fourth on Monday evening, 
according to the local government and state media. They reported that the men 
were shouting about Islamic holy war, but declined to give any further details 
of the incident.

 "When police pursued the terrorist suspects, four terrorists armed with 
knives resisted arrest. Police fired shots only after the terrorists ignored 
warnings," read an online statement from the Shenyang public security bureau 
before it was taken down without explanation.

 State-run Beijing News, citing the provincial government, said the police had 
killed the militants when they resisted them during a raid.

 "When the police tried to enter to investigate, four terrorists wearing 
headgear, holding knives and crying out 'jihad' hacked at the police," the 
Beijing News said. The news outlet reported that the men were fromXinjiang, the 
primary homeland of the Muslim Uighur minority 

, and that the "accompanying children" as well as one woman, also from 
Xinjiang, had been apprehended by authorities.

Minority Uighurs targeted

 Activists say that Uighurs, targeted as separatists 

 by the Chinese government, are simply fleeing violence in Xinjiang, where 
hundreds have died in recent years. The government blames the strife on Islamic 
militants and says Uighurs want to create their own breakaway state.

 In a statement about Monday's incident, Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the 
exile group World Uyghur Congress wrote: "The accusation that they are 
suspected terrorists exposes China's hostile and discriminatory attitude."

 "China's barbarian policy of shooting people dead before judicial 
interrogation should be prevented by the international community," said Raxit.
