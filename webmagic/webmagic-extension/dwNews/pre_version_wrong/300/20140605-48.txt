Chinese authorities have arrested 29 people as part of an "anti-terrorist" crackdown in the northwestern region of Xinjiang. Xinjiang is home to a large Muslim Uighur minority and has been accused of breeding extremism.

 The latest arrests were instigated by a May 22 attack in Urumqui 

, the capital of Xinjiang. During the incident, men, who were driving off-road 
vehicles and throwing explosives, plowed through a crowded market. Thirty-nine 
people were killed, including four suspects.

 The state news portal Xinjiang Net said that the arrested individuals were 
"suspected of crimes of inciting separatism, assembling to disturb social 
order, illegal business activities, and inciting ethnic hatred and ethnic 
discrimination."

 These arrests are part of a larger anti-terrorist operation in China in which 
hundreds of suspects 

 have been detained.

 During the past year, increased attacks in Xinjiang have posed a major 
security challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping. On April 30, two suspects 
and one bystander were killed at anUrumqui train station 

 in an apparent terrorist attack. In March, 29 people were stabbed to death at a
train station in the city of Kunming 

. Last October, three attackers and two tourists were also killed in Beijing 
when they drove their SUV through crowds which gathered in front ofTiananmen 
Gate 
, 
setting the SUV alight.

 At a meeting last month, President Xi called for "copper walls and iron 
barriers" as well as "nets spread from the earth to the sky" to stop the 
terrorists. However, he also promised more support for education and employment 
in Xinjiang.

 Experts believe that these factors are the very source of the problem, saying 
that economic marginalization of Uighurs in particular is one of the main 
causes of the violence.

 Rights groups also contend that Uighurs, who speak a Turkic language, have 
problems with discrimination. Most jobs go to migrant workers from other parts 
of China, they say.

 In the past, Uighurs frequently complained about restrictions on their 
language, culture, religious worship and other freedoms.
