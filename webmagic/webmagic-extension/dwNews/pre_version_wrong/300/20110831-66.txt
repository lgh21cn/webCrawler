Pakistan's president has promised to work more closely with China in the fight 
against terrorism. His comments came as he visited the restive province of 
Xinjiang and met officials ahead of a trade expo in Urumqi, the provincial 
capital where security was boosted.

The Chinese government is accused of oppression

It was President Zardari's first visit to China after two deadly attacks in 
the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar left 21 people dead and led to some 
tension between the two countries, as officials blamed members of the "East 
Turkmenistan Islamic Movement" for the violence and said they had been trained 
in Pakistani camps before being sent to China.

Some experts maintained that the Chinese government had not produced enough 
evidence to establish an organized terrorist threat, saying that the violence 
stemmed from a long-standing ethnic enmity in the area.

On Wednesday, China's official Xinhua news agency reported that President Asif 
Ali Zardari had met the head of the Xinjiang Communist Party Zhang Chunxian the 
day before. "Zardari stated that Pakistan opposes any terrorist activities and 
will work more closely with China in combating terrorism," the agency said in a 
statement.

Restive province

Xinjiang, which borders Pakistan, has seen many violent outbreaks in the past. 
Some members of the ethnic Uighur community have even sought refuge in 
Pakistan. The mainly Muslim Uighur community resents the immigration of Han 
Chinese into the area and accuses Beijing of oppression.

There have been several instances of violence between ethnic Uighurs and Han 
Chinese

In 2009, riots between ethnic Uighurs and Han Chinese killed almost 200 
people. Zardari endorsed Beijing's policies in the restive region at the time.

Pakistan and China have always enjoyed smooth ties in the past and these have 
become more intense in recent months as Islamabad's relationship with 
Washington has deteriorated. However, China has also expressed its concerns 
about Pakistan's security situation and its vulnerability to terrorists.
