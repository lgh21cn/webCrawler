 Reports from China's state-run CCTV on Wednesday say that Chinese authorities 
made the arrests in Beijing ten hours afterMonday's car crash 
.

 The news station's report said the three people in the car, who died in the 
attack, and the five suspects who had been arrested belonged to the same family.

 CCTV also referred to the incident as a "terrorist attack" for the first time.

An accident or an attack?

 Initially, it was unclear whether the crash had been an accident or a 
deliberate attack on the infamous square in China's capital city.

 The Chinese government's official news agency, Xinhua, quoted a police 
spokesperson as saying the crash was a "planned, organized, premeditated, 
violent terrorist act."

Chinese police announced on Tuesday 

 that they were looking for two suspects from the restive, predominantly Muslim 
province of Xinjiang in connection with the crash.

 It occurred near the main entrances to Beijing's Forbidden City when a white 
sport-utility vehicle (SUV) ploughed into pedestrians at Tiananmen Square and 
caught fire.
