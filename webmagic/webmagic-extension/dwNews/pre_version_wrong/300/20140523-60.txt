 China staged a military show of strength with a thousand personnel in 
military and police vehicles in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang region on 
Friday.

 It followed an attack in Urumqi 

 on Thursday when unknown assailants in two vehicles drove into shoppers and 
traders before throwing explosives at a street market. 31 people were killed 
and more than 90 were injured. The state-run Global Times reported Friday that 
five attackers died at the scene of Thursday's attack.

 A similar display was held in Urumqi last June after clashes left 35 people 
dead.

 Security was tight at the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, where many 
of the more than 90 wounded were being cared for. An armoured vehicle was 
parked outside, surrounded by six paramilitary police holding rifles with fixed 
bayonets.

 President Xi Jinping pledged to "severely punish violent terrorists", and 
"crack down on them with a heavy fist." Domestic security chief Meng Jianzhu 
said he would strengthen a crackdown on the "arrogance of terrorists."

 Washington condemned what it called a "horrific terrorist attack" and UN 
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said there was "no justification for the killing 
of civilians."

 Urumqi is home to a large Muslim Uihgur minority. The attack on Thursday 
happened in a largely Han neighbourhood, but some of the traders and a few of 
the customers were Uighur.

 Critics of Beijing's policies in Xinjiang say that tensions in the region 
 have 
been driven by intrusive security measures, as well as immigration by majority 
Han Chinese.
