 It was the deadliest attack in Bangkok's history. On Monday, August 17, a 
bomb was detonated in the center of the Thai capital, which killed 20 people 
and injured more than 120.

 "People are shocked and stunned," Michael Winzer, director of the Konrad 
Adenauer Foundation in Bangkok, told DW. "They are afraid that the violence 
might continue."

 The attack also broke a taboo, because for the first time the foreigners were 
targeted. The head of the Thai military junta, Prayut Chan Ocha, said Tuesday 
that surveillance cameras showed a male suspect, who is now being searched. The 
speculation that he could be an opposition supporter, however, should be dealt 
with care, says Winzer: "There are no concrete indications of a particular 
group involved in the attack. Everything is still open."
  
The security forces are looking to restore peace after the attack

Motives unclear

 The list of possible perpetrators could be long. In addition to the 
supporters of the previous government, which was toppled by the military in May 
2014, the attackers could also be Muslim separatists fighting for independence 
from Thailand for years. Even the Uighurs, a Muslim minority living in China's 
northwest, could be accused. Just recently, some 100 Uighurs were deported from 
Thailand to China.

 "The government and the security forces have reacted sensibly so far," 
Siegfried Herzog, head of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation (FNS) in Thailand, 
told DW. The government has advised the citizens to be vigilant, but it has not 
deployed a large number of troops. "The authorities do not want to play in the 
hands of the terrorists and create more panic," he added.

Further destabilization

 "Whoever is behind the attack, it will continue to politically destabilize 
the country," Winzer is convinced.

A look at southern Thailand's smoldering insurgency

A recent string of deadly attacks have turned the spotlight on the southern 
Thai insurgency, a decade-long conflict over autonomy that has claimed some 
6,500 lives. DW examines the causes and implications of the unrest. (20.07.2015)
 

 For several years, Thailand has been facing a political crisis. The military 
is struggling with the government and the reorganization of institutions and is 
expected to take some major decisions in the coming days. On August 23, a draft 
constitution will be discussed in the National Council for Peace and Order, and 
new military officers will replace the old ones in key positions by the end of 
September.

 The Bangkok attack has further complicated the situation. "After the coup, 
the military promised to bring back peace and order. Its legitimacy has 
naturally been undermined by the attack," said Winzer, adding that the military 
would likely show even more power now.

 Herzog, however, does not consider it a foregone conclusion that Thailand's 
political crisis has been aggravated by the attack. He said the attack would 
generate the feeling of solidarity in the society, which has been split for 
many years.

Economic impact

 However, both experts say the attack bears economic consequences for the 
Southeast Asian nation. The country's economy has weakened in the past years. 
Due to political infighting and chaos, the much-needed economic reforms were 
not implemented before the coup.The situation has not improved even after the 
military took power. According to Winzer, "the economy has not got back on its 
feet since the beginning of the political unrest in 2013."
  
Since the coup in May 2014, the military has the final say in all affairs of 
the state

 The bombing is also expected to harm the tourism industry, which despite 
political turmoil did not really suffer, Winzer added.

 The site of the attack, the Erawan Shrine, is a tourist hub. "The Shrine is a 
major tourist attraction in Bangkok. Pretty much everyone who goes to Bangkok 
visits the Erawan Shrine," said Winzer.

 The attackers not only had the objective of creating fear and terror among 
the public but also wanted to generate the media coverage. "That's obviously 
been achieved," said Herzog.
