The Dalai Lama Visits Frankfurt
<\TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
The Dalai Lama has started his visit to the German city of Frankfurt. He has been invited by Buddhist Organisations based in Germany. During his stay, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader will address a crowd of nearly 40,000 people at a stadium and will hold a series of lectures on Buddhism. He will also participate in seminars on topics such as peace, the environment, and the economy.

“I have nothing to say except showing my face to your camera….” In a cheerful 
mood, the Dalai Lama greeted the media in Frankfurt late Wednesday. He said he 
was happy to be in Germany again. At the press conference, the exiled leader 
did not speak about politics, but about politicians and about rules of a happy 
life.

“I believe every human being, including politicians, have a potential to 
develop inner peace," he said. “My commitment is to make this clear that 
everyone has that potential to have a happy life.”

Missing Lhasa

During the press conference, the exiled leader gave a lot of attention to a 
child reporter, who asked him one question after another. The Dalai Lama 
answered all the questions with patience. For instance, that he never liked to 
study as a child or that he meditates in his spare time. The journalist also 
asked if he ever missed his home in Tibet. The Dalai Lama responded 
thoughtfully:

“If I were in Tibet, in Potala, today I don’t think I could have seen so many 
opportunities. Because we became refugees and came to India and we found new 
opportunities. Of course inside Tibet things are very, very sad. But Lhasa’s 
climate is pleasant and I am missing that.”

Support for the plight of Tibetans

On Wednesday, he also met his longtime friend Roland Koch, the Premier of the 
state of Hesse. Koch told the Tibetan leader that Germany was concerned about 
human rights violations in Tibet and western China’s Xinjiang region. He also 
said that the nation supports the Dalai Lama’s peaceful efforts to seek 
cultural autonomy and religious freedom.

In 2007, relations between Germany and China soured over German Chancellor 
Angela Markel’s meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader in Berlin.

Beijing does not recognise the Dalai Lama’s government-in-exile. It accuses 
the Dalai Lama of using his foreign trips to engage in separatist activities to 
seek full independence. The Dalai Lama denies this accusation and insists he 
seeks only greater autonomy.
