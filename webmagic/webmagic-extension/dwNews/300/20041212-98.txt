German investigators are expected in China to examine allegations from Beijing 
that exiles from China's Uighur minority are planning terrorist activities from 
German soil, the weeklyDer Spiegel said in its edition to appear on Monday. 
Germany has so far refused to follow up China's demand that it ban two Uighur 
groups based on its territory and ban its leaders, on the grounds that it lacks 
enough evidence, according to the magazine. The Muslim, Turkish-speaking 
Uighurs advocate separatism for the Islamic, northwestern Xinjiang region of 
China and Beijing has already classified four Uighur groups as terrorists. Two 
German investigators are due to travel to China to consult the evidence 
collected by the Chinese authorities, the weekly reported. German Chancellor 
Gerhard Schr√∂der this week visited China for the sixth time in as many years, 
as China and Germany step up their cooperation both economically and 
politically.
