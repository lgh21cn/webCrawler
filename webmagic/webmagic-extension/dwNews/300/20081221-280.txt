In an interview with newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau published on Saturday, 
Dec 20, Guenter Nooke said Germany along with other European nations had to 
ensure that Guantanamo's planned closure went ahead as planned.

Nooke wants Germany to help close Guantanamo Bay

"Guantanamo is an American problem. But you can't allow its closure to fail 
because no-one knows where to put the prisoners," Nooke told the paper.

In particular, Germany should be prepared to take in some of the 17 Uighurs 
held at the prison camp in Cuba, Nooke said.

Germany urged to take in Uighur prisoners

A Muslim minority native to Central Asia, the Uighurs face political 
persecution in their homeland China, according to human rights groups. Their 
struggle for independence is strongly opposed by China. Germany has a small 
Uighur community, many of whom live in Munich.

The head of Amnesty International's Germany chapter, Barbara Lochbiler too 
urged the German government to lay particular emphasis on the Uighurs at 
Guantanamo -- there is no evidence of their involvement in terrorist activities 
-- while considering taking in prisoners.

"The Uighurs have a network in Germany. That's why it would be easier for them 
to start a new life here," Lochbiler told German news agency dpa.

Lochbiler said the German government together with other European Union 
nations should show its readiness to take in apparently innocent Guantanamo 
inmates. "Quick action is more than overdue," she said.

Guantanamo closure won't be easy

Earlier this week, a US defense official said the Pentagon is working on a 
plan to shut Guantanamo Bay that would be available to President-elect Barack 
Obama when he takes office on Jan. 20

Obama's decision to close the hugely controversial prison camp located at the 
US naval station in southeastern Cuba, has been welcomed by human rights groups 
and governments around the world. The prison has come to symbolize aggressive 
detention practices and has opened the United States to allegations of torture.

But it's largely accepted that shuttering the prison, set up by President Bush 
after the Sept 11 attack on New York and Washington, will be a tricky legal 
task. Many experts doubt whether any of the suspected Taliban and al-Qaeda 
fighters imprisoned there will receive a fair public trial.

The German government has long called for the prison's closure with Chancellor 
Angela Merkel repeatedly bringing it up in talks with President Bush.

Murat Kurnaz has published a book on his imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay

One of the first prisoners brought to Guantanamo Bay in 2002 included a 
German-born Turkish national Murat Kurnaz. He was held in the camp until 2006 
and claims to have been tortured. No trial was held.

The head of Germany's opposition Green Party, Claudia Roth, on Saturday urged 
Merkel "to convey to the US government that Germany was prepared to take in 
Guantanamo inmates."
