China’s success and failure in stopping desertification
<\TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
Approximately 2.6 million square meters of land in China consist of only sand or rock desert. That is an area about seven times the size of Germany. Efforts to stop the sand from spreading are tedious and slow.

Sand dunes reach as far as the eyes can see in Shapotou in the northwestern 
province of Ningxia. At the edge of the desert, people are fixing square-shaped 
straw mats to the ground to stabilize it. Each square measures around one by 
one meter. The straw mats cover the edge of the desert like giant fishing nets.

Tree planting has become a key government effort to fight desertification

Yong Xu Cheng of the local government administration says the method seems to 
be working. But he adds that they can only do so much. He says it is "very 
difficult to stop the sand from spreading. We can only work at the edge of the 
desert, around the railway and streets and around the peripheries of villages 
and cities." But the efforts are crucial, he believes: "We don’t have a choice. 
We have to keep the sand at bay to ensure our survival."

Desert plantations and vineyards

The square mats stabilize the sand so that grass can be planted. That will 
prepare the ground for larger plants to be planted later on. Using this method, 
people in and around Shapotou have been able to cultivate fruit plantations and 
grapevines. But in other parts of the Province Ningxia, people have already 
lost the battle against the desert.

Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang and 
Hebei are fighting severe desertification

In the province there are new settlements. Ma Dengpeng lives in one, though, 
as he explains, he had not originally wanted to move away from his previous 
home. "When the sand came it looked like black wind. It couldn’t be stopped. We 
had to stay in our house – we couldn’t leave the house." Ma says he and his 
family had to flee and that the government offered to relocate them.

Overgrazing

Ningxia was not always as arid as it is now. Large parts of northern China 
used to be vast areas of grassland. Part of the reason these grasslands are 
gone is due to climate change but also because too much water was wasted over a 
long period of time.

Over-grazing, logging, farms and population pressure, and droughts have turned 
fertile grasslands into sandy plains



The American agrarian-economist Lester Brown also believes that agriculture 
played a role. Brown explains the economic reforms of the late 1970s, "when 
agriculture shifted away from production teams into families," and the 
government lost control of livestock. He says that led to "a classic sort of 
tragedy of the commons where each family want[ed] to keep expanding the number 
of sheep and goats but with no one looking at the entire effect of this and 
what happens is once the vegetation is removed entirely from overgrazing, once 
the land is bare, then the wind takes over."

The blink of an eye

Desertification is a great threat to human life

Land which was once arable thus becomes steppe and then desert. The government 
has been fighting this process for years. It has made it illegal for herders to 
let their sheep graze outside, and it has started the so-called "green wall" - 
a project to plant millions of trees in northern China. Yong Xu Cheng says it 
has become a flagship project. He is hopeful and says that one day, mankind 
will conquer the desert completely.

Though China has had some success in pushing back the desert, it is sure to 
take a lot of time and hard work to conquer it completely. According to 
official estimates, China will be able to regain one fifth of its desert land – 
but it will take around 300 years to do so.
